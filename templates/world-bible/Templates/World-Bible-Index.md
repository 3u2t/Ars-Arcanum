# 📖 Sovereign World Bible & Codex Master Index

Welcome to your central worldbuilding hub. Every note created in this vault is interconnected via wikilinks, validated by `arcanum doctor`, and indexed dynamically below using **Dataview**.

> [!NOTE] ⚠️ EDUCATIONAL TEMPLATE (AI-GENERATED)
> **Notice**: This template was AI-generated for educational demonstration and craft guidance within the Ars Arcanum operating system.

### Features Demonstrated in This Index:
- **Central Knowledge Hub & Codex Exporter**: `codex_export` (`arcanum codex <WorldDir> --html`) — Compiles this entire index and linked notes into a standalone, searchable offline HTML encyclopedia.
- **Dynamic Dataview Aggregation**: Real-time structured query tables for characters, locations, factions, battles, councils, idioms, astrophysics, conlangs, and writing sprints.
- **System Doctor & Integrity Audits**: `world_doctor` (`arcanum doctor`) — Scans all notes indexed here for broken cross-references, orphan files, and frontmatter parse errors.
- **Offline Semantic Search**: `local_rag` (`arcanum rag "query"`) — Uses TF-IDF and SQLite FTS5 to index all vault markdown content for offline contextual query retrieval.

### How to Use for Your Projects:
1. Click any template link in the Quick Navigation Directory below to scaffold a new lore note.
2. When creating notes, assign appropriate tags (`#world/character`, `#world/location`, `#world/faction`, etc.) to automatically populate the Dataview dashboards.
3. Keep the file paths organized under their domain folders for clean structure.

### How the CLI Compilers &amp; Craft Engines Use This Template
- **Unified VaultIndex (`arcanum vault-index`)**: Indexes YAML frontmatter (including `|` and `>` multiline block scalars), `@directives`, `[[Wikilinks]]`, multi-paragraph dialogue ratios, and SHA-256 paragraph hashes (`CACHE_VERSION = 3`).
- **Epistemic POV Firewall (`arcanum validate-epistemic`)**: Compares character `knows:` baselines against chapter `learns:` and `references:` (`EPI-201..203`).
- **Planetary Calendar &amp; Route Solver (`arcanum timeline-audit`)**: Audits `world.yaml` month lengths and `Locations/` route distances (`TIME-301..302`).
- **PolyGlot Conlang Linter (`arcanum conlang-check`)**: Validates lexicon terms and phonotactics (`CON-401..402`).
- **Resource Conservation Ledger (`arcanum ledger-audit`)**: Audits `resource_pools` and chapter `state_delta` transitions (`LED-501..502`).
- **Multi-POV Narrative Braid (`arcanum braid`)**: Tracks POV word shares, tension curves, and drought alerts (`BRD-601`).
- **Phase-Aware Effort (`arcanum sprint-effort`)**: Weights First Draft (`1.00x`), On-Phase Outline (`1.00x`), Worldbuilding (`0.50x`), Revision (`0.20x`), and blocks premature editing during Drafting (`0.00x`).
- **Live Obsidian Bridge (`arcanum continuity-suite`)**: Generates `_Arcanum_Diagnostics.md` inside your vault root.
