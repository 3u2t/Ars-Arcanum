> [!NOTE] ⚠️ EDUCATIONAL TEMPLATE (AI-GENERATED)
> **Notice**: This template was AI-generated for educational demonstration and craft guidance within the Ars Arcanum operating system. It is strictly non-commercial and provided solely to demonstrate system features, mechanical schemas, and engine capabilities. Authors should replace placeholder values with their original worldbuilding details.

<summary>💡 <b>Ars Arcanum Engine Guidance & Feature Breakdown (Click to Expand)</b></summary>

### Features Demonstrated in This Template:
- **Offline Vector Cartography**: `cartography` (`arcanum cartography`) — Uses `coordinates_hex`, `map_lat`, and `map_long` to render topo layers, territorial boundaries, and regional hex maps.
- **Obsidian Leaflet Integration**: `obsidian-leaflet-plugin` — Direct support for interactive in-vault zoomable maps with marker pins and territory overlays.
- **Travel & Logistics Calculator**: `journey` (`arcanum journey --from <Origin> --to <Dest>`) — Computes march times, terrain friction multipliers, river crossings, and daily food/water requirements.
- **Planetary Climate & Biomes**: `climate` (`arcanum climate`) — Interprets Köppen climate codes (`Cfb` = Temperate Oceanic/Highland) to ensure realistic precipitation, seasonal snowlines, and orographic weather patterns.
- **8-Channel Sensory Palette**: `senses` (`arcanum senses`) — Provides rich 8-channel sensory anchors (visuals, acoustics, olfaction, gustatory tastes, tactile textures, proprioception, thermal shifts, visceral interoception).

### How to Use for Your Projects:
1. Set the `scale` from room/building level up to continental realms.
2. Link the `dominant_faction` and `associated_route` to build an interconnected travel network.
3. Use the embedded Dataview query to automatically list every character currently stationed in or originating from this location.

## 1. Overview, Geography & Topography

High Sanctuary crowns the western spur of the Aethelgard mountain shelf at an elevation of 1,450 meters. Flanked by sheer limestone cliffs to the north and deep glacial gorges to the south, it commands the only viable cartographic choke-point into the fertile Whispering Vale.

- **Coordinates / Map Grid**: Hex `34-18` (Lat: `50.4`, Long: `34.2`)
- **Terrain & Biome**: Montane karst limestone with alpine cloud-forest fringes (Köppen `Cfb`).
- **Strategic Value**: Controls the high toll-gates and aether-well siphon reservoirs.

## 2. 8-Channel Multi-Sensory Immersion Palette

- **1. Visual**: Steep slate-roofed stone keeps connected by flying buttresses; banners of silver and lapis fluttering against mist-veiled granite crags; morning light glinting off crystal astrolabes.
- **2. Auditory**: Deep bronze spire bells echoing through limestone canyons; the continuous low roar of glacial runoff in the lower flumes; clink of armored inquisitor patrols.
- **3. Olfactory**: Woodsmoke from sweet pine hearths, pungent drying mountain herbs, sharp ozone from conduit dischargers, ancient rotting vellum.
- **4. Gustatory**: Bitter mountain chicory tea, coarse salt-cured venison, fresh glacial meltwater tasting faintly of limestone minerals.
- **5. Tactile**: Damp limestone railings slick with condensation; cobblestones grooved by centuries of iron-shod carriage wheels; rough wool cloaks.
- **6. Proprioceptive / Kinesthetic**: Vertigo peering down 400-meter drop-offs from bridge spans; calf-strain climbing terraced stairways.
- **7. Thermal / Microclimate**: Biting alpine headwinds on exposed ramparts; humid, stuffy heat inside enclosed geothermal archive flumes.
- **8. Visceral / Interoceptive**: Sense of oppressive isolation when low storm clouds seal the valley; chest constriction during sudden cold snaps.

---

## 3. Society, Governance & Urban Economy
- **Dominant Inhabitants**: 45,000 residents; majority highland humans, dwarven stonemasons, and monastic scholar-inquisitors.
- **Governance**: Ruled by the High Chapter of the [[Factions/Faction-Template|Order-of-the-Silver-Dawn]] under martial charter.
- **Local Currency & Trade**: Valdorian Silver Sovereigns and stamped aether-bars (See [[Economies/Economy-Template|High-Sanctuary-Exchange]]).
- **Local Customs & Taboos**: Unsheathing iron weapons after nightfall chimes incurs immediate exile.

---

## 4. Notable Districts & Landmarks
1. **The High Chapter Citadel**: Seat of the Grand Inquisitor, housing the legendary astrolabe.
2. **The Upper Market & Scriptorium Guild**: Terraced bazaar where cartographers, spice merchants, and translators trade rare folios.
3. **The Lower Flumes & Vaults**: Subterranean catacombs where waterwheels power mechanical archive elevators.

### How the CLI Compilers &amp; Craft Engines Use This Template
- **Unified VaultIndex (`arcanum vault-index`)**: Indexes YAML frontmatter (including `|` and `>` multiline block scalars), `@directives`, `[[Wikilinks]]`, multi-paragraph dialogue ratios, and SHA-256 paragraph hashes (`CACHE_VERSION = 3`).
- **Epistemic POV Firewall (`arcanum validate-epistemic`)**: Compares character `knows:` baselines against chapter `learns:` and `references:` (`EPI-201..203`).
- **Planetary Calendar &amp; Route Solver (`arcanum timeline-audit`)**: Audits `world.yaml` month lengths and `Locations/` route distances (`TIME-301..302`).
- **PolyGlot Conlang Linter (`arcanum conlang-check`)**: Validates lexicon terms and phonotactics (`CON-401..402`).
- **Resource Conservation Ledger (`arcanum ledger-audit`)**: Audits `resource_pools` and chapter `state_delta` transitions (`LED-501..502`).
- **Multi-POV Narrative Braid (`arcanum braid`)**: Tracks POV word shares, tension curves, and drought alerts (`BRD-601`).
- **Phase-Aware Effort (`arcanum sprint-effort`)**: Weights First Draft (`1.00x`), On-Phase Outline (`1.00x`), Worldbuilding (`0.50x`), Revision (`0.20x`), and blocks premature editing during Drafting (`0.00x`).
- **Live Obsidian Bridge (`arcanum continuity-suite`)**: Generates `_Arcanum_Diagnostics.md` inside your vault root.
