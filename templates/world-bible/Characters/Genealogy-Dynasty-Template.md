# <% tp.file.title %> — Dynastic House & Lineage

> [!NOTE] ⚠️ EDUCATIONAL TEMPLATE (AI-GENERATED)
> **Notice**: This template was AI-generated for educational demonstration and craft guidance within the Ars Arcanum operating system. It is strictly non-commercial and provided solely to demonstrate system features, mechanical schemas, and engine capabilities. Authors should replace placeholder values with their original worldbuilding details.

<summary>💡 <b>Ars Arcanum Engine Guidance & Feature Breakdown (Click to Expand)</b></summary>

### Features Demonstrated in This Template:
- **Succession Claim Roster**: `genealogy` (`arcanum genealogy --succession 'House Valdoria'`) — Generates legitimate inheritance claim rankings under Agnatic/Cognatic Primogeniture, Tanistry, or Ultimogeniture.
- **Wright Inbreeding Calculator**: `genealogy` (`arcanum genealogy --inbreeding-check 'Lord-Alden-Valdoria'`) — Calculates Wright's coefficient of relationship and consanguinity to prevent accidental genetic contradictions.
- **Charted Roots & Canvas Roots Integration**: `charted-roots` — Automatically builds interactive visual family trees on Obsidian Canvas directly from note frontmatter.
- **Mermaid Pedigree Exporter**: `genealogy` (`arcanum genealogy --mermaid 'House Valdoria'`) — Renders automatic visual family tree diagrams and Ahnentafel ancestor numbers.

### How to Use for Your Projects:
1. Define the `succession_law` and list the primary dynastic line.
2. In each individual character note, set `parents: [...]`, `spouses: [...]`, and `house: "[[House-Name]]"`.
3. Open with **Charted Roots** or run `arcanum genealogy` to generate pedigree lineage charts.

### How the CLI Compilers &amp; Craft Engines Use This Template
- **Unified VaultIndex (`arcanum vault-index`)**: Indexes YAML frontmatter (including `|` and `>` multiline block scalars), `@directives`, `[[Wikilinks]]`, multi-paragraph dialogue ratios, and SHA-256 paragraph hashes (`CACHE_VERSION = 3`).
- **Epistemic POV Firewall (`arcanum validate-epistemic`)**: Compares character `knows:` baselines against chapter `learns:` and `references:` (`EPI-201..203`).
- **Planetary Calendar &amp; Route Solver (`arcanum timeline-audit`)**: Audits `world.yaml` month lengths and `Locations/` route distances (`TIME-301..302`).
- **PolyGlot Conlang Linter (`arcanum conlang-check`)**: Validates lexicon terms and phonotactics (`CON-401..402`).
- **Resource Conservation Ledger (`arcanum ledger-audit`)**: Audits `resource_pools` and chapter `state_delta` transitions (`LED-501..502`).
- **Multi-POV Narrative Braid (`arcanum braid`)**: Tracks POV word shares, tension curves, and drought alerts (`BRD-601`).
- **Phase-Aware Effort (`arcanum sprint-effort`)**: Weights First Draft (`1.00x`), On-Phase Outline (`1.00x`), Worldbuilding (`0.50x`), Revision (`0.20x`), and blocks premature editing during Drafting (`0.00x`).
- **Live Obsidian Bridge (`arcanum continuity-suite`)**: Generates `_Arcanum_Diagnostics.md` inside your vault root.
