> [!NOTE] ⚠️ EDUCATIONAL TEMPLATE (AI-GENERATED)
> **Notice**: This template was AI-generated for educational demonstration and craft guidance within the Ars Arcanum operating system. It is strictly non-commercial and provided solely to demonstrate system features, mechanical schemas, and engine capabilities. Authors should replace placeholder values with their original worldbuilding details.

<summary>💡 <b>Ars Arcanum Engine Guidance & Feature Breakdown (Click to Expand)</b></summary>

### Features Demonstrated in This Template:
- **Ecology & Food Web Simulator**: `ecology` (`arcanum ecology --trophic 4 --prey "Highland-Rock-Hare"`) — Models Lindeman 10% trophic efficiency cascades, predator-prey Lotka-Volterra population cycles, and biomass carrying capacities.
- **Bioaccumulation & Metabolic Energy Constraints**: Calculates realistic hunting territories based on daily caloric demand and prey density.
- **8-Channel Sensory Immersion Palette**: `senses` (`arcanum senses`) — Provides sharp auditory and tactile descriptive anchors for wilderness encounters.
- **Harvestable Reagent Economy**: Interlocks with `economy` and `magic_system` to define material trade values for alchemical catalysts.
- **Metadata Menu Integration**: Validated against `Templates/fileClasses/Creature.md`.

### How to Use for Your Projects:
1. Assign the correct `trophic_level` (1 to 5) and list realistic `dietary_prey`.
2. Connect the habitat to an actual location note in your vault.
3. Check that the population density respects the 10% ecological energy pyramid (apex predators must have large territories).

## 1. Physical Anatomy & Senses
- **Wingspan & Biomass**: 3.2-meter wingspan; 65 kg hollow-boned frame covered in dense, snow-white plumage with slate-grey camouflage banding.
- **Distinctive Features**: Four forward-facing amber eyes capable of thermal and aetheric infrared sensing; serrated obsidian talons.
- **Acoustic Stealth**: Specialized feather barbules silence air vortexes, rendering flight completely inaudible beyond 5 paces.
- **Sensory Capabilities**: Tracks thermal body signatures through 2 meters of packed snowdrifts.

## 2. Trophic Food-Web Dynamics & Territorial Range

```
[Level 1: Highland Silver-Lichen & Alpine Grass] (Biomass: 1,000,000 kg)
       │  (10% Energy Transfer Efficiency)
       ▼
[Level 2: Highland Rock-Hare & Snow-Goat] (Biomass: 100,000 kg)
       │  (10% Energy Transfer Efficiency)
       ▼
[Level 3: Montane Grey Fox & Snow-Viper] (Biomass: 10,000 kg)
       │  (10% Energy Transfer Efficiency)
       ▼
[Level 4: Glacial Frost-Wing Stalker (Apex)] (Biomass: 1,000 kg — ~15 individuals)
```

- **Territorial Hunting Envelope**: Each breeding pair requires a minimum of 40 km² of crags to sustain their 4,800 kcal/day demand without depleting the local hare populations.
- **Seasonal Behavior**: Descends to lower valley pastures during winter blizzards, posing severe danger to highland shepherds.

---

## 3. Combat Tactics, Hazards & Hunting Strategy
- **Primary Attack Mode**: Silent thermal dive from 200 meters elevation; breaks prey vertebrae with 4,000 N talon strike impact.
- **Cryo-Resonance Pulse**: Emits a 18 kHz acoustic shockwave that temporarily disorients mammal inner-ear balance.
- **Weaknesses**: Highly sensitive to direct flash-powder fire and intense heat; vulnerable to wing-membrane punctures from spiked pavise shields.

---

## 4. Harvestable Reagents & Alchemical Economy
- **Thermal Scent Gland**: Highly valued in perfume and scouting tinctures (Value: 45 Valdorian Sovereigns).
- **Obsidian Talons**: Ground into conductive powder for Tier 2 Aether-Weaving foci.
- **Insulating Down**: Harvested for royal arctic expedition cloaks.

### How the CLI Compilers &amp; Craft Engines Use This Template
- **Unified VaultIndex (`arcanum vault-index`)**: Indexes YAML frontmatter (including `|` and `>` multiline block scalars), `@directives`, `[[Wikilinks]]`, multi-paragraph dialogue ratios, and SHA-256 paragraph hashes (`CACHE_VERSION = 3`).
- **Epistemic POV Firewall (`arcanum validate-epistemic`)**: Compares character `knows:` baselines against chapter `learns:` and `references:` (`EPI-201..203`).
- **Planetary Calendar &amp; Route Solver (`arcanum timeline-audit`)**: Audits `world.yaml` month lengths and `Locations/` route distances (`TIME-301..302`).
- **PolyGlot Conlang Linter (`arcanum conlang-check`)**: Validates lexicon terms and phonotactics (`CON-401..402`).
- **Resource Conservation Ledger (`arcanum ledger-audit`)**: Audits `resource_pools` and chapter `state_delta` transitions (`LED-501..502`).
- **Multi-POV Narrative Braid (`arcanum braid`)**: Tracks POV word shares, tension curves, and drought alerts (`BRD-601`).
- **Phase-Aware Effort (`arcanum sprint-effort`)**: Weights First Draft (`1.00x`), On-Phase Outline (`1.00x`), Worldbuilding (`0.50x`), Revision (`0.20x`), and blocks premature editing during Drafting (`0.00x`).
- **Live Obsidian Bridge (`arcanum continuity-suite`)**: Generates `_Arcanum_Diagnostics.md` inside your vault root.
