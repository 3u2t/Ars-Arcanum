> [!NOTE] ⚠️ EDUCATIONAL TEMPLATE (AI-GENERATED)
> **Notice**: This template was AI-generated for educational demonstration and craft guidance within the Ars Arcanum operating system. It is strictly non-commercial and provided solely to demonstrate system features, mechanical schemas, and engine capabilities. Authors should replace placeholder values with their original worldbuilding details.

<summary>💡 <b>Ars Arcanum Engine Guidance & Feature Breakdown (Click to Expand)</b></summary>

### Features Demonstrated in This Template:
- **Diplomatic Paradox Sweeper**: `factions` (`arcanum factions --audit-paradoxes`) — Audits triangular treaty networks for contradictory mutual defense commitments and impossible alliance pacts.
- **Alliance Matrix Exporter**: `factions` (`arcanum factions --matrix --html dist/diplomacy_matrix.html`) — Generates an interactive diplomacy matrix, alliance webs, and rivalry tension graphs.
- **Macroeconomic Leverage & Upkeep**: `economy` — Models state treasuries, guild embargoes, and military upkeep costs.
- **Tactical Roster Synthesis**: Automatically integrates with `tactical_sim` to supply standing troop counts and unit compositions for simulated field battles.
- **Metadata Menu Integration**: Validated against `Templates/fileClasses/Faction.md`.

### How to Use for Your Projects:
1. List all `allies`, `rivals`, `vassals`, and `treaties` using exact `[[Faction-Name]]` wikilinks.
2. Define both public ideological dogma and secret council motives to generate compelling political drama.
3. The embedded Dataview query automatically updates with all characters sworn to this faction.

## 1. Executive Summary & Geopolitical Mandate
The Order of the Silver Dawn was chartered in the 8th Century to guard the northern mountain passes against abyssal incursions. Today, it operates as an autonomous sovereign military-monastic state, wielding supreme judicial and arcane authority across the northern high provinces.

### How the CLI Compilers &amp; Craft Engines Use This Template
- **Unified VaultIndex (`arcanum vault-index`)**: Indexes YAML frontmatter (including `|` and `>` multiline block scalars), `@directives`, `[[Wikilinks]]`, multi-paragraph dialogue ratios, and SHA-256 paragraph hashes (`CACHE_VERSION = 3`).
- **Epistemic POV Firewall (`arcanum validate-epistemic`)**: Compares character `knows:` baselines against chapter `learns:` and `references:` (`EPI-201..203`).
- **Planetary Calendar &amp; Route Solver (`arcanum timeline-audit`)**: Audits `world.yaml` month lengths and `Locations/` route distances (`TIME-301..302`).
- **PolyGlot Conlang Linter (`arcanum conlang-check`)**: Validates lexicon terms and phonotactics (`CON-401..402`).
- **Resource Conservation Ledger (`arcanum ledger-audit`)**: Audits `resource_pools` and chapter `state_delta` transitions (`LED-501..502`).
- **Multi-POV Narrative Braid (`arcanum braid`)**: Tracks POV word shares, tension curves, and drought alerts (`BRD-601`).
- **Phase-Aware Effort (`arcanum sprint-effort`)**: Weights First Draft (`1.00x`), On-Phase Outline (`1.00x`), Worldbuilding (`0.50x`), Revision (`0.20x`), and blocks premature editing during Drafting (`0.00x`).
- **Live Obsidian Bridge (`arcanum continuity-suite`)**: Generates `_Arcanum_Diagnostics.md` inside your vault root.
