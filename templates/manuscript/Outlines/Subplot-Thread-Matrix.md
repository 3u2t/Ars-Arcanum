# Subplot & Narrative Thread Pacing Matrix
### A Multi-Thread Pacing & Scene Architecture Engine for Novelists

> [!NOTE] ⚠️ EDUCATIONAL TEMPLATE (AI-GENERATED)
> **Notice**: This template was AI-generated for educational demonstration and craft guidance within the Ars Arcanum operating system. It is strictly non-commercial and provided solely to demonstrate system features, mechanical schemas, and engine capabilities. Authors should replace placeholder values with their original narrative threads.

<summary>💡 <b>Ars Arcanum Engine Guidance & Feature Breakdown (Click to Expand)</b></summary>

### Features Demonstrated in This Matrix:
- **Subplot Progression Grid**: `plot_matrix` (`arcanum plot`) — Tracks active plot threads, subplot convergence rates, and POV character distributions across all novel scenes.
- **Chekhov Gun Lifecycle Audit**: `plot_matrix` (`arcanum plot --audit-guns`) — Verifies that every introduced dramatic setup/foreshadowing is resolved prior to the climax.
- **Bilocation Conflict Detector**: `timeline_sync` (`arcanum timeline sync`) — Audits character coordinates to prevent impossible simultaneous appearances in separate locations.
- **Anachrony Visualizer**: `timeline_sync` (`arcanum timeline sync --anachrony`) — Maps flashbacks, flash-forwards, and dual-track chronological orders against narrative chapter flow.
- **Clean Publication Export Guarantee**: `codex_export` / `corpus_export` (`arcanum export`) — Strips all `@thread:`, `@pov:`, `@char:`, `@location:`, and `@status:` tag lines during PDF/EPUB compilation.

### How to Use for Your Projects:
1. Define a naming taxonomy for your A-Plot and subplots (e.g. `@thread: Main-Plot-Seals, Subplot-Romance`).
2. Add `@thread:` tags at the top of each chapter markdown file.
3. Open this note in Obsidian to view real-time Dataview matrices tracking subplot scene frequencies.

## 1. Overview & Narrative Thread Doctrine

Modern speculative fiction and complex novels weave multiple concurrent narrative threads across acts. Tracking their pacing, scene frequency, and convergence points ensures that:
- Subplots do not vanish for 50,000 words only to be abruptly resolved.
- Tension rises smoothly across major plot turns and act climaxes.
- POV characters maintain clear, distinct narrative stakes.

---

## 2. Tagging Conventions (`@thread:` & Metadata)

When drafting scene markdown files in `<Book>/...` (e.g. `Book-01/01_Act_I/01_Chapter_01.md`), use novelWriter metadata tags at the top of each scene file. Ars Arcanum's publication export engine automatically strips these tags during compilation so they remain strictly for internal planning and Dataview tracking.

### Core Scene Metadata Headers
```markdown
# Chapter 3: The Broken Seal

@pov: Renée
@char: Renée, Kaelen
@location: Sanctuaire_des_Étoiles
@thread: Main-Plot-Seals, Subplot-Romance, Subplot-Ancient-Order
@pacing: High-Tension
@status: Draft
```

### Recommended Thread Naming Taxonomy
| Thread Identifier | Narrative Role | Recommended Pacing / Frequency |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `@thread: Main-Plot-Conspiracy` | Central narrative arc (A-Plot) | Present in 60–70% of scenes |
| `@thread: Subplot-Romance` | Emotional & character relationship arc (B-Plot) | Woven through 20–30% of scenes |
| `@thread: Subplot-Heist-Relic` | Secondary objective / artifact quest (C-Plot) | Escalates in Act II-A to Midpoint |
| `@thread: Subplot-Faction-Rivalry`| Political / world tension | Informs antagonist counter-moves |
| `@thread: Lore-Discovery` | Worldbuilding revelations & ancient history | Peaks at Midpoint & Dark Night |

## 3. Dynamic Dataview Pacing Dashboards

*(These tables render automatically inside Obsidian when viewing this outline note)*

### A. Master Narrative Thread & Scene Matrix
```dataview
TABLE 
  pov as "POV",
  thread as "Active Plot Threads",
  location as "Location",
  pacing as "Pacing Beat",
  status as "Status"
FROM ""
WHERE !contains(file.path, "Outlines") AND file.name != "nwProject.nwx"
SORT file.path ASC
```

---

### B. Subplot Continuity & Deep-Focus Filter
*(Filter scenes touching a specific subplot, e.g. Romance or Heist)*
```dataview
TABLE 
  pov as "POV",
  location as "Location",
  status as "Draft Status"
FROM ""
WHERE (contains(thread, "Subplot-Romance") OR contains(file.tags, "#thread/romance")) AND !contains(file.path, "Outlines") AND file.name != "nwProject.nwx"
SORT file.path ASC
```

---

### C. POV Scene Distribution & Thread Balance
```dataview
TABLE count(file.link) as "Total Scenes", rows.file.link as "Scene Files"
FROM ""
WHERE !contains(file.path, "Outlines") AND file.name != "nwProject.nwx"
GROUP BY pov
```

## 4. Multi-Thread Pacing Architecture (3-Act Grid)

| Milestone / Act Range | A-Plot (Main Conflict) | B-Plot (Character / Subplot) | C-Plot (World / Antagonist) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Act I (0% – 25%)** | Ordinary World disrupted; Call received; Threshold crossed | Inciting seed planted; first meaningful encounter | Distant rumblings; thematic shadow introduced |
| **Act II-A (25% – 50%)** | Trials, learning new rules, early tactical wins | Reluctant partnership forms; friction & vulnerability | Antagonist's plan advances in background |
| **Midpoint Shift (50%)** | Active offensive shift; false victory or catastrophe | Midpoint intimacy / major relationship shift | Antagonist strikes directly; stakes become existential |
| **Act II-B (50% – 75%)** | Pressure mounts; allies fractured; Dark Night of the Soul | Subplot crisis; trust broken or sacrifice demanded | Antagonist takes dominant ground |
| **Act III (75% – 100%)** | True Need unlocked; Climax showdown & resolution | Subplot climax / emotional resolution | Order restored or world permanently transformed |

---

## 5. Clean Compilation Invariant

Ars Arcanum's exporter (`scripts/export_book.sh` / `arcanum export`) ensures that all `@thread:`, `@pov:`, `@char:`, `@location:`, and `@status:` tag lines are stripped prior to rendering Typst print PDFs and Pandoc EPUBs. You can freely annotate your draft files without fear of internal development tags leaking into your published books.

### How the CLI Compilers &amp; Craft Engines Use This Template
- **Unified VaultIndex (`arcanum vault-index`)**: Indexes YAML frontmatter (including `|` and `>` multiline block scalars), `@directives`, `[[Wikilinks]]`, multi-paragraph dialogue ratios, and SHA-256 paragraph hashes (`CACHE_VERSION = 3`).
- **Epistemic POV Firewall (`arcanum validate-epistemic`)**: Compares character `knows:` baselines against chapter `learns:` and `references:` (`EPI-201..203`).
- **Planetary Calendar &amp; Route Solver (`arcanum timeline-audit`)**: Audits `world.yaml` month lengths and `Locations/` route distances (`TIME-301..302`).
- **PolyGlot Conlang Linter (`arcanum conlang-check`)**: Validates lexicon terms and phonotactics (`CON-401..402`).
- **Resource Conservation Ledger (`arcanum ledger-audit`)**: Audits `resource_pools` and chapter `state_delta` transitions (`LED-501..502`).
- **Multi-POV Narrative Braid (`arcanum braid`)**: Tracks POV word shares, tension curves, and drought alerts (`BRD-601`).
- **Phase-Aware Effort (`arcanum sprint-effort`)**: Weights First Draft (`1.00x`), On-Phase Outline (`1.00x`), Worldbuilding (`0.50x`), Revision (`0.20x`), and blocks premature editing during Drafting (`0.00x`).
- **Live Obsidian Bridge (`arcanum continuity-suite`)**: Generates `_Arcanum_Diagnostics.md` inside your vault root.
