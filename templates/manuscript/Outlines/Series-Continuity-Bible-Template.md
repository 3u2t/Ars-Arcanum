### Managing State Drift, Character Aging & Cross-Volume Magic Rules in Ars Arcanum

> [!NOTE] ⚠️ EDUCATIONAL TEMPLATE (AI-GENERATED)
> **Notice**: This template was AI-generated for educational demonstration and craft guidance within the Ars Arcanum operating system. It is strictly non-commercial and provided solely to demonstrate system features, mechanical schemas, and engine capabilities.

### Features Demonstrated in This Blueprint:
- **Cross-Volume Trait Ledger**: `series_continuity` (`arcanum series audit ~/Universes/MyUniverse`) — Audits character eye/hair colors, scars, injuries, statuses (Alive $\to$ Deceased), and magic tier progression across multi-volume series directories defined in `universe.yaml`.
- **Timeskip Aging Validator**: `series_continuity` (`arcanum series audit --timeskip`) — Mathematical verification of biological aging between chronological series installments ($A_{\text{vol2}} = A_{\text{vol1}} + \Delta T$).
- **Intra-Volume Fact Auditor**: `continuity` (`arcanum continuity Manuscripts/Book-01`) — Scans chapter scenes for contradictory location states, relic possessions, and daylight/nighttime discrepancies.
- **Universe Omnibus Architecture**: `omnibus` (`arcanum omnibus Manuscripts/Universe --generate-recaps`) — Compiles all volumes into a unified series edition with automated interstitial "The Story So Far" summaries.

### How to Use for Your Projects:
1. Register all books and short stories in `universe.yaml` under their canonical reading order.
2. Maintain the Character State Drift Matrix across book boundaries.
3. Record hard magic system escalations to prevent retro-active power-creep plot holes.
4. Run `arcanum series audit` before publishing any sequel volume.

## 2. Character State Drift & Timeskip Aging Ledger

| Character | Book I Baseline (Year 1248) | Book II State (Year 1250 / +2 Yrs) | Book III State (Year 1255 / +7 Yrs) | Hard Invariant Constraints |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [[Characters/Character-Template\|Protagonist (Kaelen)]] | Age 28; Border Inquisitor; Amber-speckled hazel eyes; Tier 2 Weaver; unwounded. | Age 30; Knight-Commander; Lightning scar across right forearm; Tier 3 Weaver. | Age 35; High Lord Marshal; Blinded in left eye (Chapter 18, Book II); Tier 4 Master. | **Invariant**: Eye color must never change to pure blue; right forearm scar permanent. |
| [[Characters/Character-Template\|Aeloria-Vael]] | Age 24; Smuggler scout; short ash-brown hair; neutral mercenary allegiance. | Age 26; Highland Envoy; silver hair streaking; sworn to the Sovereign Order. | Age 31; Chancellor of the Third Concordat; sovereign political leader. | **Invariant**: Cannot use thermal aether (somatic defect established in Book I). |
| [[Characters/Character-Template\|Archmage-Theron]] | Age 78; Grand Inquisitor; alive and residing at High Sanctuary. | Age 80; Poisoned in Book II Finale; **Status: Deceased**. | Appears only in memory / archival transcripts. | **Invariant**: Must never appear alive in Book III narrative present. |

## 4. Magic Power-Scaling & Technological Escalation Invariants

To avoid unearned superhero escalation across volumes, each book operates under strict power caps:

1. **Book I Power Limit**: No character may weave spells exceeding **Tier 3** without immediate fatal hyperthermia.
2. **Book II Power Evolution**: The discovery of *Liquid Silver Siphons* enables temporary **Tier 4** kinetic barriers, but requires a 2-hour recharge cycle.
3. **Book III Power Climax**: **Tier 5 Archon Weaving** is unlocked only during the Grand Triad Conjunction (Syzygy), lasting exactly 12 minutes before the orbital alignment breaks.

## 5. Series Preflight & Volume Verification Checklist

- [ ] All book directories listed in `universe.yaml` compile cleanly without missing assets.
- [ ] Character ages increment consistently with established in-universe timeskips.
- [ ] Deceased characters are strictly prevented from taking active physical dialogue actions in sequels.
- [ ] In-world geographic distances (e.g. 185 km High Pass Road) remain constant across all book volumes.
- [ ] Currency values, guild heraldry, and conlang curses adhere to the core World Bible registries.

### How the CLI Compilers &amp; Craft Engines Use This Template
- **Unified VaultIndex (`arcanum vault-index`)**: Indexes YAML frontmatter (including `|` and `>` multiline block scalars), `@directives`, `[[Wikilinks]]`, multi-paragraph dialogue ratios, and SHA-256 paragraph hashes (`CACHE_VERSION = 3`).
- **Epistemic POV Firewall (`arcanum validate-epistemic`)**: Compares character `knows:` baselines against chapter `learns:` and `references:` (`EPI-201..203`).
- **Planetary Calendar &amp; Route Solver (`arcanum timeline-audit`)**: Audits `world.yaml` month lengths and `Locations/` route distances (`TIME-301..302`).
- **PolyGlot Conlang Linter (`arcanum conlang-check`)**: Validates lexicon terms and phonotactics (`CON-401..402`).
- **Resource Conservation Ledger (`arcanum ledger-audit`)**: Audits `resource_pools` and chapter `state_delta` transitions (`LED-501..502`).
- **Multi-POV Narrative Braid (`arcanum braid`)**: Tracks POV word shares, tension curves, and drought alerts (`BRD-601`).
- **Phase-Aware Effort (`arcanum sprint-effort`)**: Weights First Draft (`1.00x`), On-Phase Outline (`1.00x`), Worldbuilding (`0.50x`), Revision (`0.20x`), and blocks premature editing during Drafting (`0.00x`).
- **Live Obsidian Bridge (`arcanum continuity-suite`)**: Generates `_Arcanum_Diagnostics.md` inside your vault root.
