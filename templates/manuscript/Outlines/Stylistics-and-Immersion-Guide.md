### Features Demonstrated in This Guide:
- **Flesch-Kincaid Readability Auditor**: `stylistics` (`arcanum stylistics Manuscripts/Book-01`) — Analyzes Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (target 6.8–7.8), passive voice ratio (<2.5%), and sentence length distribution.
- **Filter Word Stripper**: `stylistics` (`arcanum stylistics Manuscripts/Book-01 --filter-words`) — Pinpoints and strips sensory filters (*"he heard"*, *"she saw"*, *"he felt"*) to pull readers into direct immersion.
- **Sliding Window Echo Finder**: `stylistics` (`arcanum stylistics Manuscripts/Book-01 --echoes`) — Flags unintended word repetition within 3-paragraph sliding windows.
- **8-Channel Sensory Scanner**: `senses` (`arcanum senses Manuscripts/Book-01`) — Visualizes paragraph-level sensory engagement across 8 modalities.
- **White Room Syndrome Sweeper**: `senses` (`arcanum senses Manuscripts/Book-01 --sweep-white-room`) — Detects under-grounded scenes.
- **Voice Bleed Matrix & Idiolect Uniqueness Scorer**: `voice` (`arcanum voice Manuscripts/Book-01`) — Compares dialogue cadence, formality indices, and unique vocabulary across POV characters.
- **Multi-Agent Editorial Council Engine**: `council` (`arcanum council audit Manuscripts/Book-01`) — Synthesizes a 4-perspective manuscript critique dossier.
- **Plot Doctor Evaluation**: `council` (`arcanum council --perspective plot`) — Audits structural tension, pacing lags, and unearned climaxes.
- **Lore Auditor Integrity**: `council` (`arcanum council --perspective lore`) — Audits continuity consistency against World Bible facts and axioms.
- **Voice Coach Analysis**: `council` (`arcanum council --perspective voice`) — Evaluates dialogue differentiation and character idiolect distinctiveness.
- **Sensory Stylist Audit**: `council` (`arcanum council --perspective sensory`) — Measures descriptive grounding, evocative metaphors, and sensory depth.

### How to Use for Your Projects:
1. Run `arcanum stylistics` during your second draft revision pass.
2. Convene the `arcanum council audit` to generate an editorial dossier before final proofing.
3. Aim for a target Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level between **6.0 and 8.5** for maximum narrative velocity without sacrificing literary elegance.
4. Eliminate passive constructions (*"was struck by"*) and filter phrases (*"he heard"*, *"she saw"*, *"he felt"*).

## 📊 Readability Benchmarks & Stylistic Targets

| Metric | Recommended Target | Diagnostic Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level** | `6.8 – 7.8` | Ensures prose flows effortlessly while allowing rich sensory vocabulary. |
| **Passive Voice Ratio** | `< 2.5%` of sentences | Keeps narrative momentum dynamic and character-driven. |
| **Weak Adverb Density** | `< 0.8 per 1,000 words`| Replaces lazy adverbs (*"shouted angrily"*) with precise active verbs (*"barked"*, *"snarled"*). |
| **Filter Word Frequency** | `< 1.2 per 1,000 words`| Eliminates unnecessary sensory filters (*"he noticed the cold"* $\to$ *"the cold bit his cheeks"*). |
| **Average Sentence Length** | `14 – 17 words` | Balances staccato action punches (4–7 words) with rhythmic descriptive clauses (22–30 words). |

## 🛠️ Filter Words: The Before & After Immersion Transformation

```
❌ DISTANT / FILTERED (Slows immersion):
   Kaelen saw the shadow moving across the floor. He could hear the sound of the guards 
   approaching and felt a cold wave of fear in his chest.

✅ DIRECT / VISCERAL IMMERSION (Ars Arcanum standard):
   A shadow stretched across the damp pine floorboards. Heavy boots echoed on the stone stairs. 
   Cold terror locked Kaelen's breath in his throat.

    "Auditory (Echoes, Timbre, Rhythm)" : 20
    "Tactile (Surface Textures, Micro-textures)" : 15
    "Thermal / Microclimate (Heat, Chill, Humidity)" : 10
    "Visceral / Interoceptive (Pulse, Diaphragm, Adrenaline)" : 10
    "Olfactory (Atmospheric Scents, Vapours)" : 5
    "Gustatory (Mouthfeel, Stress Tastes)" : 5
    "Proprioceptive / Kinesthetic (Balance, Inertia, Vertigo)" : 5

## 🔌 Obsidian Plugin Ecosystem Integration

- **LanguageTool / write-good**: Automated offline linting for cliches, weasel words, and passive constructions in real-time drafting.
- **Writing Goals Plugin**: Set session word targets (`dailyGoal: 1500`) and track chapter velocity directly from the status bar.
- **Commentator (CriticMarkup)**: Inline collaborative editing (`{++addition++}`, `{--deletion--}`, `{~~substitution~>replacement~~}`, `{==highlight==}{>>note<<}`).
- **Dataview**: Query chapter-level readability scores and filter word frequency metrics across the entire manuscript vault.

### How the CLI Compilers &amp; Craft Engines Use This Template
- **Unified VaultIndex (`arcanum vault-index`)**: Indexes YAML frontmatter (including `|` and `>` multiline block scalars), `@directives`, `[[Wikilinks]]`, multi-paragraph dialogue ratios, and SHA-256 paragraph hashes (`CACHE_VERSION = 3`).
- **Epistemic POV Firewall (`arcanum validate-epistemic`)**: Compares character `knows:` baselines against chapter `learns:` and `references:` (`EPI-201..203`).
- **Planetary Calendar &amp; Route Solver (`arcanum timeline-audit`)**: Audits `world.yaml` month lengths and `Locations/` route distances (`TIME-301..302`).
- **PolyGlot Conlang Linter (`arcanum conlang-check`)**: Validates lexicon terms and phonotactics (`CON-401..402`).
- **Resource Conservation Ledger (`arcanum ledger-audit`)**: Audits `resource_pools` and chapter `state_delta` transitions (`LED-501..502`).
- **Multi-POV Narrative Braid (`arcanum braid`)**: Tracks POV word shares, tension curves, and drought alerts (`BRD-601`).
- **Phase-Aware Effort (`arcanum sprint-effort`)**: Weights First Draft (`1.00x`), On-Phase Outline (`1.00x`), Worldbuilding (`0.50x`), Revision (`0.20x`), and blocks premature editing during Drafting (`0.00x`).
- **Live Obsidian Bridge (`arcanum continuity-suite`)**: Generates `_Arcanum_Diagnostics.md` inside your vault root.
