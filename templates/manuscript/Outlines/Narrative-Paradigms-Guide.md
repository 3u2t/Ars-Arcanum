### Features Demonstrated in This Guide:
- **16 Built-in Presets**: `manuscript_scaffold` (`arcanum scaffold MyNovel/Book-01 --structure heros_journey`) — Scaffolds complete novel directory trees pre-seeded with act divisions and beat markers across 16 canonical frameworks.
- **Custom Divisions**: `manuscript_scaffold` (`arcanum scaffold MyNovel/Book-01 --structure custom --divisions 'Prologue,Part-I,Part-II,Epilogue'`) — Scaffolds arbitrary named division layouts with strict regex validation.
- **Structure Preset Introspection**: `manuscript_scaffold` (`arcanum scaffold list`, `arcanum scaffold info kishotenketsu`) — Inspects all registered structural presets and target percentage curves.
- **Multi-Paradigm Beat Mapper**: `structure` (`arcanum structure Manuscripts/Book-01 --paradigm three_act`) — Evaluates narrative milestone percentages (Hook at 1%, Inciting Incident at 12%, Climax at 90%) across any selected paradigm.
- **Midpoint Milestone Check**: `structure` (`arcanum structure Manuscripts/Book-01 --paradigm three_act`) — Verifies that the active reversal occurs within the 48%–52% milestone envelope.

### How to Use for Your Projects:
1. Choose the narrative framework that best fits your story's genre, pacing, and philosophical theme.
2. Run `arcanum scaffold Manuscripts/MyNovel --preset <preset_key>` to scaffold the act/chapter folders.
3. Run `arcanum structure Manuscripts/MyNovel` anytime during drafting to check for structural sagging or pacing drag.

## 📐 Deep Dive: Kishōtenketsu (Conflict-Free Twist Dynamics)
Unlike Western conflict-driven models that rely on opposing antagonistic forces, Kishōtenketsu structures narrative tension around an unexpected contextual juxtaposition:

```

and peaceful town life.    and scholar routines.     star-map from a sunken empire.       but a prison for the stars.

### How the CLI Compilers &amp; Craft Engines Use This Template
- **Unified VaultIndex (`arcanum vault-index`)**: Indexes YAML frontmatter (including `|` and `>` multiline block scalars), `@directives`, `[[Wikilinks]]`, multi-paragraph dialogue ratios, and SHA-256 paragraph hashes (`CACHE_VERSION = 3`).
- **Epistemic POV Firewall (`arcanum validate-epistemic`)**: Compares character `knows:` baselines against chapter `learns:` and `references:` (`EPI-201..203`).
- **Planetary Calendar &amp; Route Solver (`arcanum timeline-audit`)**: Audits `world.yaml` month lengths and `Locations/` route distances (`TIME-301..302`).
- **PolyGlot Conlang Linter (`arcanum conlang-check`)**: Validates lexicon terms and phonotactics (`CON-401..402`).
- **Resource Conservation Ledger (`arcanum ledger-audit`)**: Audits `resource_pools` and chapter `state_delta` transitions (`LED-501..502`).
- **Multi-POV Narrative Braid (`arcanum braid`)**: Tracks POV word shares, tension curves, and drought alerts (`BRD-601`).
- **Phase-Aware Effort (`arcanum sprint-effort`)**: Weights First Draft (`1.00x`), On-Phase Outline (`1.00x`), Worldbuilding (`0.50x`), Revision (`0.20x`), and blocks premature editing during Drafting (`0.00x`).
- **Live Obsidian Bridge (`arcanum continuity-suite`)**: Generates `_Arcanum_Diagnostics.md` inside your vault root.
