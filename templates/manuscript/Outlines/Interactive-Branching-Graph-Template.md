# Interactive Branching Narrative Graph & Choice Node Specification

> [!NOTE] ⚠️ EDUCATIONAL TEMPLATE (AI-GENERATED)
> **Notice**: This template was AI-generated for educational demonstration and craft guidance within the Ars Arcanum operating system. It is strictly non-commercial and provided solely to demonstrate system features, mechanical schemas, and engine capabilities. Authors should replace placeholder values with their original branching story design.

### Features Demonstrated in This Template:
- **Topological Dead-End Detector**: `branching_graph` (`arcanum branch audit Manuscripts/InteractiveNovel`) — Audits DAG topology to detect unreachable orphan nodes, cycle traps, and broken choice endpoints.
- **Subway Map HTML Exporter**: `branching_graph` (`arcanum branch graph Manuscripts/InteractiveNovel --html dist/branch_map.html`) — Compiles interactive multi-track narrative subway maps with state mutation visualizers.
- **Twine / Ink Transpiler**: `branching_graph` (`arcanum branch export Manuscripts/InteractiveNovel --format ink`) — Transpiles markdown choice nodes into industry-standard Ink and Twine Harlowe scripts.

### How to Use for Your Projects:
1. Use unique node identifiers (e.g. `Node_01_ArchiveGate`).
2. Specify choice options and state prerequisites.
3. Keep branching manageable by using periodic **Convergence Attractors** (funneling choices back to major act climaxes).

## 📜 Choice Node Specification Ledger

### Node 01: The Splintered Archive Gate
- **Scene File**: `Book-01/01_Act_I/01_Chapter_01.md`
- **Dramatic Context**: Iron hammers smash through the lower archive gates. Scribes flee in terror.
- **Available Choices**:
  1. **Option A (The Flume Escape)**:
     - *Action*: Stuff the treaty into your tunic, kick open the waterwheel gate, and plunge into the rushing mountain flume.
     - *State Mutations*: `+1 Treaty_Fragments`, `-10 Armor_Integrity`.
     - *Next Target*: `Node 02A`.
  2. **Option B (The Heroic Defense)**:
     - *Action*: Draw your dueling saber, activate the silver focus pendant, and form a defensive square in front of Master Vance.
     - *Prerequisite*: `has_silver_pendant == true`.
     - *State Mutations*: `-2 Pendant_Charges`, `+1 Vance_Gratitude`.
     - *Next Target*: `Node 02B`.

## 🎯 Reconvergence Attractor Doctrine
To prevent combinatorial state explosion (2 $\to$ 4 $\to$ 8 $\to$ 16 branches), all branching paths must reconverge at major narrative anchor nodes at the end of each act (e.g. [[Factions/Tactical-Skirmish-Battle-Template|The-Battle-of-the-Silver-Ridge]]).

### How the CLI Compilers &amp; Craft Engines Use This Template
- **Unified VaultIndex (`arcanum vault-index`)**: Indexes YAML frontmatter (including `|` and `>` multiline block scalars), `@directives`, `[[Wikilinks]]`, multi-paragraph dialogue ratios, and SHA-256 paragraph hashes (`CACHE_VERSION = 3`).
- **Epistemic POV Firewall (`arcanum validate-epistemic`)**: Compares character `knows:` baselines against chapter `learns:` and `references:` (`EPI-201..203`).
- **Planetary Calendar &amp; Route Solver (`arcanum timeline-audit`)**: Audits `world.yaml` month lengths and `Locations/` route distances (`TIME-301..302`).
- **PolyGlot Conlang Linter (`arcanum conlang-check`)**: Validates lexicon terms and phonotactics (`CON-401..402`).
- **Resource Conservation Ledger (`arcanum ledger-audit`)**: Audits `resource_pools` and chapter `state_delta` transitions (`LED-501..502`).
- **Multi-POV Narrative Braid (`arcanum braid`)**: Tracks POV word shares, tension curves, and drought alerts (`BRD-601`).
- **Phase-Aware Effort (`arcanum sprint-effort`)**: Weights First Draft (`1.00x`), On-Phase Outline (`1.00x`), Worldbuilding (`0.50x`), Revision (`0.20x`), and blocks premature editing during Drafting (`0.00x`).
- **Live Obsidian Bridge (`arcanum continuity-suite`)**: Generates `_Arcanum_Diagnostics.md` inside your vault root.
