### Professional Voice Actor Briefing & Acoustic Proofing Pipeline in Ars Arcanum

> [!NOTE] ⚠️ EDUCATIONAL TEMPLATE (AI-GENERATED)
> **Notice**: This template was AI-generated for educational demonstration and craft guidance within the Ars Arcanum operating system. It is strictly non-commercial and provided solely to demonstrate system features, mechanical schemas, and engine capabilities.

### Features Demonstrated in This Specification:
- **Audiobook Proofing & Phonetic Pipeline**: `audio_proof` (`arcanum audio-proof Manuscripts/Book-01`) — Synthesizes acoustic SSML markup, word cadence distributions, and listening timing estimation.
- **SSML Prosody Optimization**: `audio_proof` (`arcanum audio-proof --ssml`) — Calibrates prosodic rate, pitch modulation, and dialogue pause durations.
- **Chunked TTS Buffer Exporter**: `audio_proof` (`arcanum audio-proof --chunk 500`) — Chunks manuscripts into deterministic buffers for offline Piper / eSpeak NG TTS synthesis.
- **Narration Duration Estimator**: `audio_proof` (`arcanum audio-proof --estimate`) — Computes exact finished audio hours based on a standard 155 words-per-minute commercial narration pace.
- **Conlang IPA Harmonizer**: Links directly with `conlang` (`Languages/Glossary-Conlang-Template.md`) to provide International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) guidance for voice talent.

### How to Use for Your Projects:
1. Populate the Phonetic Pronunciation Lexicon for all proper nouns, character names, and spell incantations.
2. Provide character voice notes (pitch, accent, vocal fry, pacing) for the audio narrator.
3. Use the SSML markup templates to proof chapter rhythm acoustically with offline TTS before hiring voice talent.

## 2. Character Vocal Profiles & Voice Talent Direction

| Character | Accent / Regional Dialect | Pitch & Timbre | Mannerisms & Cadence Notes | Sample Opening Line |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Narrator (Third Person)** | Neutral Transatlantic / BBC Received Pronunciation | Warm Baritone, crisp consonants | Steady, authoritative, measured pacing; accelerates slightly during action. | *"The third seal was cold as winter iron when Kaelen touched the lead."* |
| [[Characters/Character-Template\|Kaelen (Protagonist)]] | Highland Northern | Low Tenor, dry, gravelly edge | Analytical, terse, clipped sentence endings; habitual mid-sentence pauses when calculating odds. | *"Step back, or I will let the aether cannons calculate the difference."* |
| [[Characters/Character-Template\|Aeloria-Vael]] | Coastal Basin Vernacular | Lyrical Alto, rapid and melodic | Fluid, sharp, sardonic wit; upward inflection on rhetorical questions. | *"You scholars always count the stones while the roof is caving in."* |
| [[Characters/Character-Template\|Archmage-Theron]] | Ancient High Imperial | Deep Bass, resonant, slow | Gravitas; resonant chest timbre; deliberate 1.5s pauses between key injunctions. | *"In ferro veritas, in aether salus. Remember your vows, child."* |

## 4. SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language) Formatting Prototype

For testing acoustic prosody and synthetic narration with offline engines (Piper / eSpeak NG):

```xml
<speak version="1.0" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis" xml:lang="en-US">
  <prosody rate="medium" pitch="0%">
    <s>The ink on the treaty was dry, <break time="400ms"/> but the blood spilt to seal it was still warm.</s>
  </prosody>

  <prosody rate="-5%" pitch="-2st">
    <!-- Archmage Theron Dialogue -->
    <voice name="en_GB-southern_male">
      <s>"Step back from the gate, Commander."</s>
    </voice>
  </prosody>

  <prosody rate="+10%" pitch="+1st">
    <!-- Fast-Paced Action Narrative -->
    <s>The iron hammers struck the cedar timber with a deafening crash. <break time="200ms"/> Wood splintered. Dust boiled from the flumes.</s>
  </prosody>
</speak>

### How the CLI Compilers &amp; Craft Engines Use This Template
- **Unified VaultIndex (`arcanum vault-index`)**: Indexes YAML frontmatter (including `|` and `>` multiline block scalars), `@directives`, `[[Wikilinks]]`, multi-paragraph dialogue ratios, and SHA-256 paragraph hashes (`CACHE_VERSION = 3`).
- **Epistemic POV Firewall (`arcanum validate-epistemic`)**: Compares character `knows:` baselines against chapter `learns:` and `references:` (`EPI-201..203`).
- **Planetary Calendar &amp; Route Solver (`arcanum timeline-audit`)**: Audits `world.yaml` month lengths and `Locations/` route distances (`TIME-301..302`).
- **PolyGlot Conlang Linter (`arcanum conlang-check`)**: Validates lexicon terms and phonotactics (`CON-401..402`).
- **Resource Conservation Ledger (`arcanum ledger-audit`)**: Audits `resource_pools` and chapter `state_delta` transitions (`LED-501..502`).
- **Multi-POV Narrative Braid (`arcanum braid`)**: Tracks POV word shares, tension curves, and drought alerts (`BRD-601`).
- **Phase-Aware Effort (`arcanum sprint-effort`)**: Weights First Draft (`1.00x`), On-Phase Outline (`1.00x`), Worldbuilding (`0.50x`), Revision (`0.20x`), and blocks premature editing during Drafting (`0.00x`).
- **Live Obsidian Bridge (`arcanum continuity-suite`)**: Generates `_Arcanum_Diagnostics.md` inside your vault root.
