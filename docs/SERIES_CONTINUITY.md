## 1. Overview & Theoretical Rationale

The **Ars Arcanum Series Continuity Engine** (`scripts/lib/series_continuity.py`) is an offline cross-volume canon validator, multi-decade timeline synchronizer, and retroactive continuity (retcon) impact analyzer engineered for multi-book sagas, trilogies, and expansive speculative franchises.

In multi-volume storytelling, narrative continuity challenges scale non-linearly with series volume count:
1. **Chronological Age Drift (`SER-101`)**: A character born in Year 400 is declared 22 years old in Book 1 (Year 420) and 25 years old in Book 3 (Year 435), violating chronological invariance.
2. **Deceased Entity Resurrections (`SER-102`)**: Characters killed in earlier volumes participating in live scenes without explicit resurrection, clone, or flashback declarations.
3. **Power Scaling & Arcane Inflation (`SER-103`)**: Magical abilities or technologies established with strict boundaries in Book 1 escalating beyond all thermodynamic or narrative constraints by Book 4.
4. **Unmanaged Retcons (`SER-104`)**: Altering world lore or character backstories in later volumes without auditing how those changes invalidate previous books' plot logic.
5. **Cross-Volume Chekhov Abandonment (`SER-105`)**: Long-range foreshadowing planted in Book 1 left unresolved when the series concludes.

The Series Continuity Engine compiles the unified Universe Bible (`Universes/<Name>/series_bible.yaml`), aggregates timeline markers across all book directories (`Book-01/`, `Book-02/`, etc.), verifies character aging functions, and tracks retcon impact propagation.

## 2. Multi-Volume Chronology & Aging Formulations

### 2.1 Character Chronological Aging Invariant
Let character $C$ have a canonical birth date $t_{\text{birth}}(C)$ in the in-world calendar. For Book $k$ set across the temporal interval $[t_{\text{start}}(k), t_{\text{end}}(k)]$:

$$\text{Age}_{\text{min}}(C, k) = t_{\text{start}}(k) - t_{\text{birth}}(C)$$

$$\text{Age}_{\text{max}}(C, k) = t_{\text{end}}(k) - t_{\text{birth}}(C)$$

$$\text{Age Invariance Rule}: \quad \forall t \in [t_{\text{start}}(k), t_{\text{end}}(k)], \quad |\text{ProseAge}(C, t) - (t - t_{\text{birth}}(C))| < 1.0 \text{ Year}$$

If a character's prose age deviates from calculated astronomical calendar years, the engine raises `SER-101: AGE_DRIFT_DETECTED`.

### 2.2 Transgenerational Dynastic Drift
For sagas spanning multiple centuries (e.g. Isaac Asimov's *Foundation*, Frank Herbert's *Dune*):

$$\text{Generation Index}: \quad g(C) = \left\lfloor \frac{t_{\text{birth}}(C) - t_{\text{epoch}}}{\Delta t_{\text{generation}}} \right\rfloor \quad (\Delta t_{\text{gen}} \approx 25\text{--}30\text{ years})$$

$$\text{Dynastic Invariant}: \quad t_{\text{birth}}(\text{Child}) > t_{\text{birth}}(\text{Parent}) + 14 \text{ Years}$$

## 3. Retcon Taxonomy & Impact Propagation

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                        RETROACTIVE CONTINUITY (RETCON) TAXONOMY                   |
+-------------------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
| 1. ADDITIVE       | 2. ALTERATIVE                 | 3. SUBTRACTIVE                |
| Filling in unseen | Overwriting established facts | Removing previously canonized |
| historical gaps   | with new explanations. High   | events from current continuity|
| without altering  | risk of breaking causal logic | (e.g. declaring a side story  |
| existing events.  | in earlier volumes.           | non-canonical / apocryphal).  |
+-------------------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
```

### 3.1 Retcon Impact Graph Analysis
When an alterative retcon $\mathcal{R}$ is declared in Book $k$ on proposition $P$, the engine traces its backward causal dependency cone in the lore DAG:

$$\text{Invalidated Scenes}(\mathcal{R}) = \{ S \in \bigcup_{j < k} \text{Book}_j \mid S \text{ causally depends on } \neg P \}$$

If $|\text{Invalidated Scenes}| > 0$, the author must either:
- Provide an in-universe epistemological explanation (*"Character $X$ was lied to in Book 1"*).
- Execute a formal text patch across earlier manuscripts.

## 4. Subfeatures Matrix & Diagnostic Codes

| Diagnostic Code | Flag | Trigger Condition | Worldbuilding Correction |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SER-101` | `AGE_DRIFT` | Character stated age in Book $k$ conflicts with series timeline calendar. | Correct stated age or adjust time gap between book volumes. |
| `SER-102` | `POST_MORTEM_ACTIVITY` | Character deceased in Book $j$ acts in Book $k$ ($k > j$) without resurrection tag. | Tag as vision/flashback or replace character with successor. |
| `SER-103` | `POWER_INFLATION` | Magic power output in Book $k$ exceeds Book 1 rules by $> 300\%$ without catalyst. | Re-introduce severe casting costs, exhaustion, or material limits. |
| `SER-104` | `UNRESOLVED_RETCON` | Alterative retcon breaks causal necessity of a major Act II plot point in Book 1. | Add diegetic justification (unreliable narrator, forged records). |
| `SER-105` | `DANGLING_SERIES_GUN` | Chekhov relic introduced in Book 1 remains unmentioned by finale of Book 3. | Plant payoff in final volume climax or explicitly destroy relic. |
| `SER-106` | `GEOGRAPHIC_EXPANSION_ERROR` | Kingdom boundaries or travel distances in Book 4 contradict Book 1 maps. | Synchronize regional maps in `World/Cartography/`. |

## 6. Worked Step-by-Step Example

### Scenario: Resolving a Magic System Retcon Between Book 2 and Book 4
1. **Book 2 Statement (Alpha Canon)**: *"The Sunken Gate can only be opened by royal blood of House Vance."*
2. **Book 4 Plot Need (Author Intent)**: The protagonist (a peasant thief with zero royal blood) must unlock the Gate to prevent total apocalypse.
3. **Naïve Retcon (Fails `SER-104`)**: Writing that anyone can open the gate with sufficient willpower. This invalidates Book 2's entire civil war where House Vance was hunted for their blood.
4. **Epistemic Retcon (Valid Solution)**:
   - In Book 4, the protagonist discovers the ancient inscription was mistranslated by the corrupt Scholastic Priesthood in Year 110.
   - The original Old Valyrian phrase was *"blood of the flame"* (referring to anyone who has consumed the sacred Fire Lotus), which House Vance hoarded to monopolize power.
   - **Audit Result**: Validated. Book 2 character beliefs remain intact as historical misinformation, preserving causal stakes.
