## 1. Overview & Theoretical Rationale

The **Ars Arcanum Plot Matrix Engine** (`scripts/lib/plot_matrix.py`) is an offline structural continuity tracker, subplot braiding auditor, and dramatic irony modeler designed for multi-POV epics, mystery novels, and branching speculative fiction.

In complex long-form storytelling, managing multiple interlocking narrative threads introduces severe combinatorial complexity:
1. **Subplot Abandonment / Dormancy (`PLT-101`)**: Secondary storylines or character arcs introduced in Act I that disappear for large chapter spans, losing emotional momentum.
2. **Dangling Plot Threads (`PLT-102`)**: Primary conflicts or investigative questions left unresolved at the manuscript's climax.
3. **Chekhov's Gun Malfunctions (`PLT-103`)**: Critical climax resolutions that lack prior introduction or priming, reading as unearned *Deus ex Machina*, or introduced items that never fire (*Chekhov Violations*).
4. **Dramatic Irony Asymmetry**: Mismatches between audience knowledge and character knowledge that inadvertently collapse tension or spoil mystery reveals.
5. **Clue Distribution Imbalance**: Clues bunched together at the finale or red herrings lacking internal diegetic plausibility.

The Plot Matrix maps every tagged plot thread, character arc, and clue across chapters, computes gap penalties, verifies Chekhov lifecycles, models audience vs character epistemic states, and renders interactive multi-lane visual timelines.

## 2. Multi-Thread Plotting Architectures

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                        CANONICAL PLOTTING ARCHITECTURES                           |
+-------------------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
| BRAIDED SUBPLOTS  | PARALLEL STORYLINES           | CONVERGING THREADS (NEXUS)    |
| Interleaved A/B/C | Independent tracks running in | Disparate characters/threads  |
| threads alternating | parallel with thematic echoes | funneled into a single        |
| across chapters.  | but zero physical contact.    | catastrophic climax arena.    |
+-------------------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
```

### 2.1 Braided Subplots (The A/B/C Plot Rhythm)
In braided narratives, chapters alternate between the primary driving quest (A-Plot), secondary romantic or political alliances (B-Plot), and tertiary comedic or introspective character arcs (C-Plot):
- **Harmonic Alternation**: Avoid running the same thread for more than 2 consecutive chapters unless entering a dedicated climax sequence.
- **Thematic Rhyming**: Events in the B-Plot reflect or invert the moral dilemmas faced in the A-Plot within the same structural act.

### 2.2 Parallel Storylines (The Polyphonic Architecture)
Multiple protagonist streams operate in isolation across geographic or temporal distances. Unity is maintained through:
- **Synchronized Milestone Pacing**: All parallel tracks hit their respective Midpoints or Dark Nights of the Soul within identical percentage bands ($W_{\text{cum}} \pm 5\%$).
- **Thematic Resonance**: Contrast in how different factions or cultural perspectives interpret the central macro crisis.

### 2.3 Converging Threads (The Funnel / Nexus Model)
Disparate, seemingly unrelated threads begin at maximum distance at $t = 0.0$ and gradually draw closer across narrative time until they physically collide at the Climax ($t \approx 0.88$):

$$\text{Distance}(T_A, T_B, t) = D_0 \cdot (1 - t)^\alpha \quad (\alpha \ge 1.0)$$

## 3. Mathematical Models & Algorithmic Formulations

### 3.1 Thread Gap Penalty & Dormancy Score
Let a manuscript have $K$ chapters. For a specific plot thread $T$, let its active scene occurrences be indices $\mathcal{S}_T = \{s_1, s_2, \dots, s_n\}$ where $1 \le s_1 < s_2 < \dots < s_n \le K$.

The gap between consecutive occurrences is:

$$g_j = s_{j+1} - s_j - 1 \quad \text{for } j \in \{1, \dots, n-1\}$$

The **Dormancy Index** $\mathcal{D}(T)$ penalizes gaps exceeding the threshold $G_{\text{max}}$ (default: 4 chapters):

$$\mathcal{D}(T) = \sum_{j=1}^{n-1} \max\left(0, \, g_j - G_{\text{max}}\right)^2$$

A dangling thread is flagged if $K - s_n > G_{\text{dangling}}$ and $T$ is not explicitly closed via an `@end-thread` or `@resolve` tag.

### 3.2 Chekhov's Gun 3-Stage Lifecycle Invariant
Every high-impact narrative element, relic, weapon, or forensic clue $G$ must traverse a deterministic 3-stage lifecycle:

```
[ Stage 1: Introduction ] --------> [ Stage 2: Priming / Reminder ] --------> [ Stage 3: Detonation / Payoff ]
   t_intro ∈ [0.0, 0.30]                  t_prime ∈ [0.40, 0.75]                      t_payoff ∈ [0.80, 0.95]
   Salience: Low (Naturalistic)           Salience: Moderate (Context Shift)          Salience: Decisive (Consequence)
```

$$\text{Chekhov Invariant}: \quad t_{\text{intro}} < t_{\text{prime}} < t_{\text{payoff}} \quad \land \quad (t_{\text{payoff}} - t_{\text{prime}}) \le \Delta t_{\text{memory}}$$

- If $t_{\text{intro}}$ exists but $t_{\text{payoff}}$ never occurs $\implies$ `PLT-103: UNFIRED_GUN` (Violates Chekhov's rule).
- If $t_{\text{payoff}}$ occurs without $t_{\text{intro}} \implies$ `PLT-103: DEUS_EX_MACHINA` (Unearned resolution).
- If $t_{\text{payoff}} - t_{\text{intro}} > 0.60$ with zero $t_{\text{prime}} \implies$ `PLT-103: AMNESIAC_PAYOFF` (Audience forgot the item).

### 3.3 Dramatic Irony Matrix & Suspense Metric
Let $\mathcal{K}_{\text{aud}}(t)$ be the set of propositions known to the audience at chapter $t$, and $\mathcal{K}_{\text{char}}(t)$ be the set known to character $C$:

$$\text{Epistemic Gap}: \quad \mathcal{E}_C(t) = \mathcal{K}_{\text{aud}}(t) \setminus \mathcal{K}_{\text{char}}(t)$$

$$\text{Dramatic Irony Index}: \quad I_D(C, t) = \frac{|\mathcal{E}_C(t)|}{|\mathcal{K}_{\text{aud}}(t)|} \in [0.0, 1.0]$$

- **Mystery / Puzzle Mode ($I_D \approx 0.0$)**: The audience and detective share identical knowledge; pleasure derives from cognitive deduction (*Whodunit*).
- **Suspense / Thriller Mode ($I_D \ge 0.50$)**: The audience knows the bomb is beneath the table, but the characters are calmly having dinner (Hitchcockian suspense).
- **Tragic Irony ($I_D \to 1.0$)**: The audience knows the prophecy or trap that the protagonist is actively running into (Sophoclean dread).

### 3.4 Mystery Clue Distribution & Fair-Play Matrix
In fair-play mysteries (Knox's Decalogue, Van Dine's 20 Rules), all clues must be presented prior to the deduction scene:

$$\text{Fair Play Invariant}: \quad \forall c \in \mathcal{C}_{\text{vital}}, \quad t_{\text{clue}}(c) \le t_{\text{deduction}} - \epsilon$$

$$\text{Red Herring Ratio}: \quad \mathcal{R}_{\text{herring}} = \frac{|\mathcal{C}_{\text{distractor}}|}{|\mathcal{C}_{\text{vital}}|} \in [0.5, 2.0]$$

If $\mathcal{R}_{\text{herring}} > 3.0$, the narrative risks alienating the reader through deceptive obfuscation; if $\mathcal{R}_{\text{herring}} < 0.3$, the mystery becomes transparent and trivial.

## 4. Subfeatures Matrix & Diagnostic Codes

| Code | Diagnostic Flag | Cause | Corrective Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| `PLT-101` | `DORMANT_SUBPLOT` | Thread absent for $> 4$ consecutive chapters. | Insert a brief B-story scene or weave thread reference into dialogue. |
| `PLT-102` | `DANGLING_THREAD` | Subplot remains unresolved after Chapter $K$. | Tag with `@resolve: thread_name` or add a resolution scene in Act III. |
| `PLT-103` | `CHEKHOV_VIOLATION` | Gun introduced but unfired, or fired without priming. | Plant introduction in Act I or remove irrelevant item emphasis. |
| `PLT-104` | `IRONY_COLLAPSE` | Secret revealed to audience with zero narrative exploitation. | Create dramatic near-misses or tension beats exploiting the gap. |
| `PLT-105` | `UNFAIR_CLUE_BURST` | $> 70\%$ of vital mystery clues dropped in final $15\%$ of text. | Distribute clues evenly across Act II investigation sequences. |
| `PLT-106` | `THREAD_COLLISION` | Two incompatible threads resolved in the same scene without causal link. | Disentangle resolution into sequential causal beats. |

## 6. Worked Step-by-Step Example

### Scenario: Braiding a 3-Thread Murder Mystery in a Fantasy Citadel
1. **Thread A**: The Royal Assassination Investigation.
2. **Thread B**: The Alchemical Guild Strike (B-Story).
3. **Thread C**: The Detective's Relapse / Personal Debt (Character Arc).

```
Chapter Stream:
Ch 01: [A-Intro] [C-Intro]               -> Murder discovered; debt collector threatens detective.
Ch 02: [A-Investigate] [B-Intro]          -> Clue #1 found; Guild strike blocks trade.
Ch 03: [A-Investigate] [Gun-Plant: Ring]  -> Chekhov Stage 1: Ancient signet ring found in gutter.
Ch 04: [B-Strike] [C-Relapse]             -> A-Thread dormant for 1 chapter (Valid, gap = 1).
Ch 05: [A-Interrogate] [B-Strike]         -> Detective questions guild master; tensions escalate.
...
Ch 15: [A-Climax] [Gun-Payoff: Ring]     -> Ring unlocks hidden vault; murderer exposed!
Ch 16: [B-Resolve] [C-Resolve]           -> Guild strike settled; debt paid with reward money.
```

- **Gap Audit**: Maximum gap on Thread A is 1 chapter (Well below threshold 4).
- **Chekhov Validation**: Ring planted at Ch 03 ($t = 0.18$), primed at Ch 09 ($t = 0.56$), detonated at Ch 15 ($t = 0.93$). **Status: Fully Validated**.
