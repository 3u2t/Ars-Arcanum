## 1. Overview & Theoretical Rationale

The **Ars Arcanum Filesystem & Security Architecture** (`scripts/lib/_bootstrap.py`, `scripts/lib/lockfile.py`) provides crash-consistent file writing primitives, cross-platform concurrency locking, and path-traversal sanitizers engineered to protect creative manuscripts and World Bibles from corruption during unexpected power loss, OS crashes, or multi-process race conditions.

Writing long-form fiction on consumer desktop computers exposes unpublished manuscripts to subtle storage hazards:
1. **Torn Writes & Zero-Length Truncation**: Standard file writing (`open(file, 'w')`) immediately truncates the existing file on disk before writing the new payload. If power fails or the process is killed mid-write, the manuscript is permanently destroyed or reduced to a $0$-byte stub.
2. **Filesystem Cache Desynchronization**: Modern operating systems buffer file writes in volatile RAM. Without explicit kernel-level synchronization (`fsync`), data residing in RAM buffers is lost upon system reboot.
3. **Concurrent Mutation Collisions**: When automated background tasks (such as corpus indexers or timeline synchronization engines) write to the same files as the author, race conditions cause interleaved garbage text.
4. **Path Traversal Vulnerabilities**: User-supplied identifiers in CLI flags that accept unvalidated relative paths (`../../etc/`) can inadvertently overwrite critical operating system files.

|  [Step 1: Unique Tempfile]  -----> Writes payload to '.tmp_<uuid>' in same fs |

Ars Arcanum enforces strict storage durability contracts across all file mutations, ensuring that your manuscripts remain pristine and uncorrupted under all hardware and software failure modes.

## 2. Invariant Storage Contracts & Mathematical Durability

### 2.1 The Atomic Write Lifecycle Formalism
Let $F_{\text{dest}}$ be the target manuscript file and $\mathcal{P}$ be the new manuscript payload to be persisted.

The atomic state transition operator $\mathcal{T}_{\text{atomic}}(F_{\text{dest}}, \mathcal{P})$ guarantees that at any arbitrary point of power interruption $t_{\text{crash}}$:

$$\text{State}(F_{\text{dest}}, t_{\text{crash}}) \in \Big\{ \text{State}_{\text{original}}(F_{\text{dest}}), \; \mathcal{P} \Big\}$$

The file is guaranteed to never be in an intermediate, truncated, or corrupted half-written state:

$$\text{State}(F_{\text{dest}}, t_{\text{crash}}) \ne \emptyset \quad \land \quad \text{State}(F_{\text{dest}}, t_{\text{crash}}) \ne \text{TornWrite}$$

```mermaid

    participant App as Application Logic
    participant VFS as Virtual File System (RAM)
    participant Disk as Physical Storage Controller
    participant Dest as Destination File (Chapter_01.md)

    App->>VFS: 1. Create .tmp_x78a.tmp in same directory
    App->>VFS: 2. Write payload P to .tmp_x78a.tmp
    App->>VFS: 3. file.flush() (Flush user-space buffers)
    App->>Disk: 4. os.fsync(fd) (Force physical block write)
    Disk-->>App: 5. Disk sync acknowledged
    App->>VFS: 6. os.close(fd)
    App->>Disk: 7. os.replace(.tmp_x78a.tmp, Chapter_01.md) (Atomic Rename)
    Disk-->>Dest: 8. Pointer atomically swapped in directory tree
```

### 2.2 Cross-Platform Concurrency Locking Matrix (`ArcanumLock`)
To prevent concurrent process write collisions, Ars Arcanum implements an RAII-style context manager acquiring exclusive non-blocking advisory locks:

$$\text{Lock Acquisition}: \quad \mathcal{L}(F) = \begin{cases}
\texttt{fcntl.flock}(\text{fd}, \texttt{LOCK\_EX} \mid \texttt{LOCK\_NB}) & \text{on POSIX (Linux/macOS)} \\
\texttt{msvcrt.locking}(\text{fd}, \texttt{LK\_NBLCK}, 1) & \text{on Windows (NTFS)}
\end{cases}$$

If another process holds the lock, the engine raises `ConcurrencyConflictError` immediately rather than deadlocking the writing session.

```python
# Context Manager Usage Pattern
from scripts.lib.lockfile import ArcanumLock

with ArcanumLock("Manuscripts/Book-01/.lock", timeout=5.0):
    # Exclusive write operations guaranteed safe
    atomic_write("Manuscripts/Book-01/Chapter_01.md", payload)
```

### 2.3 Path Traversal Sanitization Regex
All user-provided identifiers (volume names, draft branches, character handles, snapshot tags) are validated against a strict character allowlist:

$$\text{ValidIdentifier}(S) \iff S \in \Sigma^* \quad \text{where } \Sigma = [\texttt{A-Za-z0-9\_-}]$$

Any string containing directory separators (`/`, `\`), null bytes (`\0`), or parent directory traversal sequences (`..`) is rejected with a `PathTraversalSecurityError`.

## 3. Subsystem API & Core Helper Functions

| Function Name | Location | Signature | Operational Invariant / Guarantee |
|---|---|---|---|
| `atomic_write()` | `_bootstrap.py` | `(path: Path, data: str, backup: bool = False) -> None` | Writes to tempfile, fsyncs, closes, and atomically swaps with destination. |
| `read_file_safe()` | `_bootstrap.py` | `(path: Path) -> str` | Reads file with strict UTF-8 decoding and explicit error diagnostics. |
| `sanitize_filename()` | `_bootstrap.py` | `(name: str) -> str` | Strips invalid characters and enforces POSIX-safe filename bounds. |
| `ArcanumLock` | `lockfile.py` | `class ArcanumLock(path: Path, timeout: float)` | RAII cross-platform file locking context manager. |
| `safe_relpath()` | `_bootstrap.py` | `(target: Path, base: Path) -> Path` | Computes relative paths while asserting no upward traversal breakout. |

## 4. Content Security Policy & Offline Isolation

All filesystem utilities operate 100% offline without network sockets or telemetry:

```html
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src 'none'; style-src 'unsafe-inline'; script-src 'unsafe-inline'; img-src data:; media-src data: blob:;">
```

## 5. Tri-Fold Creative Advisory Resolutions

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Alert["Filesystem Alert: CONCURRENCY_LOCK_ACTIVE (Process 4812 is currently compiling corpus.db)"] --> PathA["Path A: Hard Realism / Sequential Wait"]
    Alert --> PathB["Path B: Speculative / Process Diagnostic"]
    Alert --> PathC["Path C: Authorial Sovereignty"]
    
    PathA --> SolA["Wait 3 seconds for active compilation lock to release naturally."]
    PathB --> SolB["Inspect process ID to ensure no orphaned background task is hung."]
    PathC --> SolC["Pass --force-unlock if previous system crash left stale lock file."]
```

### Scenario: Stale File Lock Encountered After System Crash
- **Path A (Hard Realism / Safe Sequential Retry)**:
  - The engine automatically waits with exponential backoff for up to $5.0\text{ seconds}$ before raising a timeout error.
- **Path B (Process Telemetry Inspection)**:
  - Check whether the PID recorded in `.lock` is still active in the operating system process table. If dead, the engine safely reclaims the lock.
- **Path C (Authorial Sovereignty)**:
  - If a hard reboot left an orphaned `.lock` file, pass `--force-unlock` or manually delete the `.lock` file to resume writing immediately.
