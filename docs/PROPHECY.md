## 1. Overview & Theoretical Rationale

The **Ars Arcanum Prophecy Engine** (`scripts/lib/prophecy.py`) is an offline predictive constraint validator, dramatic irony modeler, and narrative foreshadowing auditor engineered for epic fantasy authors, mythological worldbuilders, and tragedy dramatists.

In mythological and high-fantasy literature, prophecies are profound structural promises that establish intense reader expectations. When handled poorly, prophecies collapse into lazy exposition or unearned plot convenience. Authors encounter four major architectural failure modes:
1. **Unearned Declared Fulfillment (`PRO-101`)**: Labeling a prophecy as fulfilled in lore notes when zero corresponding fulfillment events occur in manuscript prose.
2. **Dead Target Entity (`PRO-102`)**: The destined "Chosen One" dies prematurely before completing the prophecy's mandatory clauses without an explicit subversion tag.
3. **Orphan Lore Prophecies (`PRO-103`)**: Sprawling mythological verses created in worldbuilding bibles that never appear in prose or influence character motivations.
4. **Dramatic Irony Decay (`PRO-104`)**: Failing to calculate the epistemic gap between what the reader knows from the prophecy versus what the characters understand.

The Prophecy Engine extracts prophecy definitions (`World/Cosmology/Prophecies/*.md`), cross-validates them against character dossiers and manuscript `@prophecy:` tags, computes clause-level Boolean fulfillment vectors, models dramatic irony metrics, and generates interactive HTML audit reports.

```

### 2.1 The Oedipal Self-Fulfilling Causal Loop
In self-fulfilling loops, the foreknowledge of the outcome is the necessary causal prerequisite for the event occurring:

$$\text{Knowledge}(\Phi) \xrightarrow{\text{Spawns Fear}} \text{Action}(A_{\text{evasion}}) \xrightarrow{\text{Causes}} \text{Event}(E_{\text{prophesied}})$$

Without the Oracle's warning, King Laius would never have abandoned Oedipus on the mountain; without being abandoned, Oedipus would never have encountered his father at the crossroads.

### 2.2 The Cassandra Paradox
The prophet possesses veridical prescience, but is cursed with zero communicative persuasion:

$$\mathcal{P}(\text{Event} = \text{True} \mid \text{Prophecy}) = 1.0 \quad \land \quad \mathcal{P}(\text{Belief} = \text{True} \mid \text{Audience}) = 0.0$$

The dramatic engine shifts from *mystery* ("Will it happen?") to *tragic inevitability and suspense* ("How will they fail to listen?").

### 2.3 Semantic Ambiguity vs Literal Fulfillment
Prophecies frequently exploit **semantic equivocation** and **metaphorical misdirection**:
- *Syntactic Ambiguity*: "No man of woman born shall harm Macbeth" $\to$ Macduff was delivered via caesarean section.
- *Geographic / Toponymic Equivocation*: "You will die beneath Jerusalem" $\to$ King Henry IV dies in the Jerusalem Chamber at Westminster Abbey.
- *Entity Metaphor*: "When the Dragon reborn weeps over the broken stone" $\to$ Refers to a specific broken seal, not geological stone.

### 2.4 Divergent Timeline Prophecies & Prescience Traps
In hard speculative fiction (e.g. Frank Herbert's *Dune*), prescience operates as a quantum superposition of possible worldlines:

$$\Phi(t) = \int_{\Omega} \Psi(w, t) \cdot \mathcal{P}(w) \, dw$$

The prophet does not merely observe the future; the act of observation collapses probability waves into a rigid, inescapable "Golden Path," turning prescience into a temporal prison.

## 3. Mathematical Modeling & Constraint Satisfaction (CSP)

### 3.1 Prophecy as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)
A prophecy $\Phi$ is formalized as a tuple $(X, D, C)$:
- $X = \{x_1, x_2, \dots, x_k\}$: Set of predictive condition variables (clauses).
- $D = \{\{0, 1\}\}^k$: Boolean domain of clause states ($0 = \text{unresolved}, 1 = \text{fulfilled}$).
- $C = \{\phi_1, \phi_2, \dots, \phi_m\}$: Temporal, spatial, and agentic constraints linking clauses.

The global prophecy fulfillment state vector $\vec{S}(\Phi) \in \{0, 1\}^k$:

$$\text{Status}(\Phi) = \begin{cases} 
\text{unfulfilled} & \text{if } \sum_{i=1}^k x_i = 0 \\
\text{partially\_fulfilled} & \text{if } 0 < \sum_{i=1}^k x_i < k \\
\text{fulfilled} & \text{if } \sum_{i=1}^k x_i = k \land \neg \text{Subverted} \\
\text{subverted} & \text{if } \sum_{i=1}^k x_i = k \land \text{IronicInversion} \\
\text{broken} & \text{if } \exists i \text{ s.t. } x_i \text{ is rendered logically impossible}
\end{cases}$$

### 3.2 Dramatic Irony Divergence Metric ($D_{\text{irony}}$)
Dramatic irony measures the cognitive divergence between the reader's prophetic knowledge $\mathcal{K}_{\text{reader}}(t)$ and the viewpoint character's knowledge $\mathcal{K}_{\text{char}}(t)$ at manuscript chapter $t$:

$$D_{\text{irony}}(t) = \frac{|\mathcal{K}_{\text{reader}}(t) \setminus \mathcal{K}_{\text{char}}(t)|}{|\mathcal{K}_{\text{reader}}(t)|} \in [0.0, 1.0]$$

```
Dramatic Irony D_irony(t)

## 4. Subfeatures Matrix & Diagnostic Codes

| Diagnostic Code | Flag | Trigger Condition | Worldbuilding Correction |
|---|---|---|---|
| `PRO-101` | `UNRESOLVED_FULFILLMENT` | Prophecy marked `status: fulfilled` in lore but has unresolved clauses in manuscript. | Add fulfillment scene tags `@prophecy-fulfilled` in prose. |
| `PRO-102` | `DEAD_CHOSEN_ONE` | Destined bearer marked as deceased prior to clause completion. | Declare subversion, lineage transference, or resurrect entity. |
| `PRO-103` | `ORPHAN_PROPHECY` | Verse exists in `World/` but never referenced in prose. | Weave verse into scholar dialogue, religious texts, or dreams. |
| `PRO-104` | `PREMATURE_ANAGNORISIS` | Character discovers prophecy meaning before Act II Midpoint. | Delay realization to preserve dramatic tension. |
| `PRO-105` | `CLAUSE_CONTRADICTION` | Clause $x_a$ requires character living, while $x_b$ requires their prior sacrifice. | Clarify metaphorical vs physical death conditions. |

### 5.3 CLI Reference & Diagnostic Severity
```bash
# Audit prophecy clause fulfillment across vault (exit 0 advisory default)
arcanum prophecy --audit

# Generate interactive HTML dramatic irony report
arcanum oracle --html report.html

# Run strict validation (fails with exit code 1 if hard contradictions exist)
arcanum prophecy --audit --strict
```

#### Diagnostic Findings Classification:
- `PRP-101` (`[OBSERVATION]`): Prophecy declared fulfilled in lore notes with no detected manuscript fulfillment event.
- `PRP-102` (`[LENS_NOTE]`): Target entity died prior to fulfilling key prophesied clauses without subversion annotation.
- `PRP-103` (`[OBSERVATION]`): Unreferenced orphan prophecy detected in lore notes.

*Note: All `PRP-*` findings are advisory by default and can be suppressed via `suppressed_rules: [PRP-101, PRP-102]` in `constitution.yaml`.*

## 6. Worked Step-by-Step Example

### Scenario: High-Fantasy Equivocal Prophecy ("The Unborn King")
1. **The Verse**: *"No king crowned in gold shall strike the Shadow Lord, nor shall he fall while the Iron Gate stands whole."*
2. **Character Assumption (Tragic Blunder)**: The allied lords believe they need a queen to strike him, and spend three chapters defending the Iron Gate fortress.
3. **The Literal Inversion (Payoff)**:
   - The protagonist was crowned with a wreath of rowan leaves (*crowned in wood, not gold*).
   - The antagonist lured them into the fortress; to kill him, the allies must *demolish their own Iron Gate* to breach the warding field.
4. **Epistemic Tracking**:
   - Ch 02–14: Audience and characters assume figurative language ($D_{\text{irony}} = 0.10$).
   - Ch 15: Protagonist finds ancient architectural schematic showing the Iron Gate is a resonance anchor ($D_{\text{irony}} = 0.90$ for readers and hero vs army commanders).
   - Ch 20: Climax demolition and victory.
