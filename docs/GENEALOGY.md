## 1. Executive Summary & Epistemological Architecture

This document serves as the **Master Craft Reference Manual** for royal genealogies, succession law jurisprudence, Wright's inbreeding coefficient mathematics, pedigree collapse, and heraldic cadency in speculative fiction worldbuilding. Active family tree visualization is powered in-vault by **Canvas Roots** (`charted-roots`) and **StoryLine**, while complex multi-generational dynastic databases are compiled via **Gramps** (see [Master External Tools Guide](file:///docs/guides/EXTERNAL_TOOLS_AND_PLUGINS.md)).

Hereditary monarchies and aristocratic houses are governed by legal precedent, biological kinship, and genetic realities. Fictional lineages frequently suffer from four critical structural contradictions:
1. **Contradictory Succession Claims (`GEN-101`)**: Two claimants citing legal succession precedents that are mathematically or legally mutually exclusive within the declared constitution of the realm.
2. **Pedigree Collapse Amnesia (`GEN-102`)**: Depicting royal families practicing endogamous cousin/sibling marriage for twenty consecutive generations without calculating Wright's inbreeding coefficient ($F$) or modeling homozygous genetic disorders (e.g., Habsburg jaw, hemophilia).
3. **Heraldic Rule of Tincture Violations (`GEN-103`)**: Blazons placing metal directly on metal (gold on silver) or color on color (red on blue), violating fundamental historical optical contrast rules.
4. **Cadency Mark Chaos**: Younger sons and cadet branches displaying identical heraldic crests without difference marks (labels, crescents, mullets), causing identity confusion on the battlefield.

The Genealogy Engine ingests dynastic manifests (`World/Lineages/*.md`), builds directed acyclic lineage graphs (DAGs), traces Wright's inbreeding coefficients ($F$), simulates succession claim hierarchies, and validates heraldic blazons.

## 2. Dynastic Succession Systems & Legal Frameworks

The legitimacy of a royal claim depends entirely on the codified or traditional **Succession System** governing the crown.

```
                      [ SUCCESSION SYSTEM TAXONOMY ]
  1. STRICT AGNATIC (Salic Law)      ──► Eldest living male through strictly male lines
  2. MALE-PREFERENCE (Cognatic)      ──► Sons before daughters; daughters before uncles
  3. ABSOLUTE COGNATIC (Primogeniture)─► Eldest child regardless of biological sex
  4. ULTIMOGENITURE (Minorat)        ──► Youngest living child inherits crown/homestead
  5. TANISTRY / SENIORITY            ──► Eldest capable adult male elected within royal clan
  6. ELECTIVE MONARCHY               ──► Council of Prince-Electors / Nobles cast ballots
  7. PARTIBLE INHERITANCE (Gavelkind)──► Realm split equally among all surviving sons
```

### 2.1 Exhaustive Succession System Comparison

| Succession System | Primary Inheritance Rule | Female Succession Status | Civil War Risk Factors | Historical & Speculative Analogs |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Agnatic Primogeniture (Salic Law)** | Eldest surviving son of eldest male line | Completely barred from inheriting or transmitting claims | High when monarch has only daughters (Uncle vs Daughter) | Kingdom of France, Valyrian Freehold |
| **Male-Preference Primogeniture** | Eldest son; daughters inherit if no sons exist | Permitted as second-tier fallback | Medium (Daughter vs Younger Brother of King) | Kingdom of England (pre-2013), House Stark |
| **Absolute Cognatic Primogeniture** | Eldest child regardless of gender | Equal parity with male heirs | Low (Clear mathematical birth order) | Modern UK/Sweden, House Martell (Dorne) |
| **Ultimogeniture (Minorat)** | Youngest surviving child inherits | Varies by culture | High (Older, militarily experienced brothers resent boy king) | Nomadic Steppe Khanates, Folkloric Tale Kings |
| **Agnatic Seniority / Tanistry** | Eldest living brother/uncle of the royal clan | Barred (Focuses on adult warrior competence) | Extreme (Brothers murder nephews to accelerate turn) | Kievan Rus' (Rota system), Gaelic Clans |
| **Elective Monarchy** | Sovereign elected by college of magnates | Varies by electoral charter | High (Foreign bribery, interregnum civil wars) | Holy Roman Empire, Polish-Lithuanian Sejm |
| **Partible (Gavelkind)** | Realm divided equally among all legitimate sons | Barred or limited to dowries | Catastrophic (Realm fragments into warring micro-kingdoms)| Carolingian Empire (Treaty of Verdun 843) |

## 3. Mathematical Population Genetics & Inbreeding

```
                         [ INBREEDING LOOP (PEDIGREE COLLAPSE) ]
                                    (Common Ancestor A)
                                          /      \
                                         /        \
                                   (Father F)   (Mother M)
                                         \        /
                                          \      /
                                        (Offspring X)
                     F_X = (1/2)^(n₁ + n₂ + 1) * (1 + F_A)
```

### 3.1 Wright’s Inbreeding Coefficient ($F$)
Sewall Wright (1922) formulated the inbreeding coefficient $F$, defining the probability that two alleles at any given gene locus in an individual are identical by descent (IBD):

$$F_X = \sum_{A} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{n_1 + n_2 + 1} (1 + F_A)$$

Where:
- $A$: A common ancestor in both maternal and paternal lineages.
- $n_1$: Number of genealogical generational steps from Father to common ancestor $A$.
- $n_2$: Number of genealogical generational steps from Mother to common ancestor $A$.
- $F_A$: Inbreeding coefficient of the common ancestor $A$ ($0.0$ if non-inbred).

#### Benchmark Reference Values for $F$:
- **Unrelated Parents**: $F = 0.000$ ($0.0\%$)
- **Second Cousins**: $F = \frac{1}{64} \approx 0.0156$ ($1.56\%$)
- **First Cousins**: $F = \frac{1}{16} = 0.0625$ ($6.25\%$)
- **Uncle-Niece / Double First Cousins**: $F = \frac{1}{8} = 0.125$ ($12.5\%$)
- **Full Sibling / Parent-Offspring**: $F = \frac{1}{4} = 0.250$ ($25.0\%$)
- **Charles II of Spain (Multi-Generational Inbreeding)**: $F = 0.254$ ($25.4\%$)
- **Ptolemaic Dynasty (Brother-Sister for 5+ Generations)**: $F > 0.35\text{--}0.40$ ($40.0\%$)

### 3.2 Pedigree Collapse (The Implex Paradox)
An individual possesses $2^k$ theoretical ancestors at generation $k$ in the past ($2$ parents, $4$ grandparents, $8$ great-grandparents, $\dots, 2^{30} \approx 1.07 \times 10^9$ ancestors 30 generations ago).

Because $1.07\text{ billion}$ exceeds the entire global human population in the High Middle Ages, ancestral trees must loop back onto themselves. The **Pedigree Collapse Factor** ($\text{PCF}$):

$$\text{PCF}(k) = 1 - \frac{N_{\text{distinct ancestors}}(k)}{2^k}$$

In endogamous aristocratic dynasties, $\text{PCF}$ exceeds $60\%\text{–}80\%$ by generation 5, resulting in severe homozygous genetic vulnerabilities.

## 4. Royal Heraldry, Cadency Marks & Blazonry

Heraldry is the visual identification grammar of feudal aristocracy.

```
                      [ THE NINE CADENCY MARKS ]
    1st Son: Label (Three Points)     ──►  ┌───┬───┐
    2nd Son: Crescent (Moon)          ──►    (
    3rd Son: Mullet (Five-Point Star) ──►    ★
    4th Son: Martlet (Footless Bird)  ──►    🕊
    5th Son: Annulet (Ring)           ──►    O
    6th Son: Fleur-de-lis (Lily)      ──►    ⚜
```

### 4.1 The Fundamental Rule of Tincture
Tinctures are divided into two strict optical classes:
1. **Metals**: *Or* (Gold / Yellow), *Argent* (Silver / White).
2. **Colors**: *Gules* (Red), *Azure* (Blue), *Sable* (Black), *Vert* (Green), *Purpure* (Purple).

#### The Absolute Heraldic Law:
> **Metal must never be placed upon metal, nor color upon color.**

- *Valid (High Contrast)*: Gold lion on Red shield (*Or on Gules*), Silver sword on Blue field (*Argent on Azure*).
- *Invalid (`GEN-103` Violation)*: Red dragon on Black field (*Gules on Sable*), Gold crown on Silver shield (*Or on Argent*).

### 4.2 Marshalling: Impalement & Quartering
- **Impalement (Marriage)**: Shield split vertically down the center. Husband's paternal arms on dexter (viewer's left); wife's arms on sinister (viewer's right).
- **Quartering (Inherited Dynastic Lineages)**: Shield divided into four or more quadrants, displaying arms from maternal heiresses whose fathers had no surviving male heirs.

## 5. Worked Step-by-Step Dynastic Calculation

### Scenario: The Grand Succession Crisis & Inbreeding Audit
King Valerius IV dies without a living son.
- Surviving daughter: **Princess Aurelia** (Age 26).
- Deceased younger brother: **Prince Cassian**, who left a legitimate 10-year-old son, **Lord Lucan**.
- The parents of Princess Aurelia were **first cousins** (King Valerius IV and Queen Lyra shared grandparents Duke Titus and Duchess Mara).

#### Step 1: Calculate Wright's Inbreeding Coefficient for Princess Aurelia
Duke Titus and Duchess Mara are two common ancestors ($A_1, A_2$).
For each ancestor, the generational path from Father to Ancestor is $n_1 = 1$ (Father is son of Titus), and Mother to Ancestor is $n_2 = 1$ (Mother is daughter of Titus).
Assuming ancestors Titus and Mara were non-inbred ($F_A = 0$):

$$F_{\text{Aurelia}} = \sum_{A \in \{\text{Titus}, \text{Mara}\}} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{1 + 1 + 1} (1 + 0) = \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^3 + \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^3 = \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{16} + \frac{1}{16} = 0.0625 \ (6.25\%)$$

*Result*: Princess Aurelia carries an inbreeding coefficient of $F = 0.0625$ (standard first-cousin offspring).

#### Step 2: Resolve Succession Priority Under Different Legal Charters
- **Case A: Strict Agnatic (Salic Law)**:
  Princess Aurelia is barred. Claim passes through the male line to her nephew, **Lord Lucan** (1st in line).
- **Case B: Male-Preference Primogeniture**:
  King Valerius IV had no surviving sons, so the claim passes to his eldest surviving daughter, **Princess Aurelia** (1st in line). Lord Lucan is relegated to 2nd in line.
- **Succession War Diagnostic (`GEN-101`)**: If the realm's legal constitution is ambiguous between Salic tradition and feudal primogeniture, Lord Lucan's regent will declare Princess Aurelia a usurper, triggering a high-probability civil war.
