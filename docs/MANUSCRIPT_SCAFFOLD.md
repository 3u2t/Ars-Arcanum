## 1. Overview & Architectural Rationale

The **Ars Arcanum Manuscript Scaffolding Engine** (`scripts/lib/manuscript_scaffold.py`) is an offline project bootstrapping suite, narrative architecture generator, structural beat calculator, and chapter metadata initializer engineered for novelists, serial fiction authors, screenwriters, and multi-volume series architects.

Starting a long-form novel from an empty folder frequently leads to common structural pathologies:
1. **Pacing Debt & Structural Drift**: Writing without predetermined pacing milestones leads to bloated first acts, sagging middles ("Act II depression"), and rushed, unearned climaxes.
2. **Metadata Incoherence**: Drafting chapters with inconsistent frontmatter headers (`@pov`, `@timeline`, `@thread`, `@status`) breaks downstream timeline synchronization, story canvas rendering, and revision heatmaps.
3. **Blank-Page Paralysis**: Starting a new chapter without explicit dramatic goals, obstacles, and thematic questions stalls creative velocity.
4. **Filesystem Security Flaws**: Naive scaffolding tools that accept unvalidated user input can introduce directory traversal vulnerabilities (`../`) or invalid POSIX characters.

## 2. Mathematical Formalism & Beat Proportion Equations

### 2.1 Target Word Count Allocation
For a manuscript with total target word count $W_{\text{target}}$ and $N$ structural acts/divisions with fractional weights $\{w_1, w_2, \dots, w_N\}$ where $\sum_{i=1}^N w_i = 1.0$:

$$\text{Target Words}(\text{Division}_i) = \lfloor W_{\text{target}} \times w_i \rfloor$$

For any specific dramatic beat $B_k$ situated at canonical milestone percentage $p_k \in [0.0, 1.0]$:

$$\text{Target Cumulative Milestone}(B_k) = \lfloor W_{\text{target}} \times p_k \rfloor$$

If Division $i$ is planned for $C_i$ discrete chapters, the target word budget per chapter is:

$$\overline{W}_{\text{chapter}}(i) = \frac{\text{Target Words}(\text{Division}_i)}{C_i}$$

```
Word Allocation Waveform (e.g. 100,000-word novel):
Cumulative Words
 100k |                                                        [Climax / Res]
      |                                              [All Hope Lost]
  50k |                              [Midpoint Shift]
      |               [Catalyst / Break into Two]

## 4. Chapter Template Architecture & Frontmatter Schema

When a project is scaffolded, each generated chapter file is pre-populated with standard YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
title: "Chapter 01: The Ashen Threshold"
chapter_number: 1
part: "Act I: Departure"
beat: "Opening Image / Inciting Catalyst"
target_words: 3500
current_words: 0
pov_character: "Kaelen Vane"
setting: "The Broken Spire of High Vale"
timeline_day: 1
timeline_time: "06:00 Solar"
plot_threads:
  - "main_quest_seal"
  - "kaelen_brother_mystery"
status: "draft"
---

# Chapter 01: The Ashen Threshold

> **Dramatic Beat Objective**: Establish the protagonist's Ordinary World, demonstrate their core flaw, and introduce the disruptive anomaly that shatters normalcy.

## Scene 1: The Ritual of the Dawn

<!-- Draft scene prose below -->

```

## 6. Tri-Fold Creative Advisory Resolutions

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Alert["Scaffold Alert: WORD_BUDGET_OVERRUN (Chapter 5 reached 6,200 words against 3,500 budget)"] --> PathA["Path A: Hard Realism / Structural Splitting"]
    Alert --> PathB["Path B: Speculative / Diegetic Expansion"]
    Alert --> PathC["Path C: Authorial Sovereignty"]
    
    PathA --> SolA["Split Chapter 5 into 5A and 5B at the midpoint cliffhanger."]
    PathB --> SolB["Rebalance downstream chapters by trimming transition beats."]
    PathC --> SolC["Adjust total target word count in manuscript.yaml to reflect epic scope."]
```

### Scenario: Chapter Word Budget Overrun
- **Path A (Hard Realism / Structural Splitting)**:
  - The scene expanded beyond standard chapter bounds. Locate the scene climax at word 3,200 and split into two chapters (`Chapter 5: The Incursion` and `Chapter 6: The Aftermath`).
- **Path B (Pacing Rebalance)**:
  - Keep the extended chapter as an intentional "Tentpole Setpiece" and reduce target word counts for adjacent reflective cool-down chapters.
- **Path C (Authorial Sovereignty)**:
  - Update `target_words` in `manuscript.yaml` to accommodate an organic increase in story scope.
