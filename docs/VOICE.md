# Author Craft Masterclass: Character Voice Profiling, Idiolects & Sociolects (`docs/VOICE.md`)
> **Domain B: Linguistics, Conlang, Idioms & Stylistics** | **Category:** Author Craft & Narrative Doctrine | **Status:** Theoretical Framework & Writing Rubric

---

## 1. Overview & Theoretical Rationale

In ensemble storytelling, distinct character voices are the primary conduit through which personality, social hierarchy, psychological trauma, cultural origin, and intellectual posture are conveyed to the reader. When every character in a cast shares the author's subconscious linguistic habits, sentence lengths, and vocabulary distribution, the manuscript suffers from **Voice Bleed (Character Homogeneity)**—shattering immersion and collapsing dramatic tension into a single flat monologue.

This doctrine provides a systematic framework combining sociolinguistics, psycholinguistics, and stylometric principles to help authors craft, profile, and differentiate character voices across long-form speculative fiction manuscripts.

## 2. Theoretical Foundations of Character Voice & Dialogic Polyphony

### 2.1 Mikhail Bakhtin's Theory of Heteroglossia and Polyphony
In *The Dialogic Imagination: Four Essays* (1981), Russian literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin demonstrated that the novel is inherently **polyphonic** (multi-voiced). Unlike poetry, which historically strives for a unified authorial register, the masterclass novel is a battleground of **Heteroglossia** (the coexistence of multiple, conflicting social dialects, professional jargons, generational slang, and ideological idioms):

- **Centripetal Forces**: Forces that push toward linguistic uniformity, central authority, and standardized grammar (e.g., the high-court lexicon of an empire).
- **Centrifugal Forces**: Forces that decentralize and stratify language into street vernacular, underworld cants, technical jargon, and rebellious patois.

In a vital fantasy or sci-fi ensemble, characters do not simply say different things; they inhabit radically different socio-ideological speech worlds.

### 2.2 John Gardner's 5 Levels of Psychic Distance
In *The Art of Fiction* (1983), John Gardner codified **Psychic Distance**—the degree of cognitive proximity between the narrator's lens and the character's internal sensory reality:

```
[ LEVEL 1: Omniscient Cinematic Overview ]
"It was winter of the year 1853. A carriage rolled into the town of Oakhaven."

[ LEVEL 2: Neutral Third-Person Observation ]
"Miller stepped out of the coach, carrying his leather satchel."

[ LEVEL 3: Close Third-Person / Focalized ]
"The wind bit Miller's neck. He pulled his collar tight against the freezing sleet."

[ LEVEL 4: Free Indirect Discourse ]
"God, what a wretched hole of a village. Why had he ever accepted this contract?"

[ LEVEL 5: Pure Stream of Consciousness / First-Person Visceral ]
"Freezing mud. Fingers numb. Two hours till dawn. Got to find the key."
```

Masterclass character voice requires conscious calibration of psychic distance: high-status or emotionally detached characters maintain Levels 1–3, while visceral, traumatized, or impulsive characters operate at Levels 4–5.

### 2.3 The Anatomy of an Idiolect
An **Idiolect** is the unique linguistic fingerprint of an individual speaker. It is determined by five structural components:
1. **Lexical Domain**: The primary metaphor reservoirs the character draws from (a blacksmith speaks using metallurgical metaphors: *quenched, tempered, slag*; a void-navigator speaks in vectors and orbital harmonics).
2. **Syntactic Complexity**: Preference for short, blunt paratactic clauses vs. sweeping, subordinate hypotactic periods.
3. **Formality & Contraction Posture**: Strict aversion to contractions (*"I cannot permit this"*) signaling aristocratic pride or non-native formal training vs. heavy contraction density (*"Ain't no way we're makin' it"*) signaling street pragmatism.
4. **Interrogative / Rhetorical Stance**: Frequency of trailing thoughts ($\dots$), assertive interruptions ($—$), leading questions ($?$), or exclamatory commands ($!$).
5. **Speech Latency & Subtext**: What the character *refuses* to state directly. Taciturn characters communicate through subtextual evasion and tactical monosyllables.

## 3. Computational Stylometry & Mathematical Formulations

    line [78, 85, 92, 10, 15, 65]
```

### 3.1 Type-Token Ratio (TTR) & Lexical Breadth
For a character's dialogue corpus containing $N$ total tokens and $V$ distinct unique word types:

$$\text{TTR} = \frac{V}{N}, \qquad \text{Guiraud's Root Index } R = \frac{V}{\sqrt{N}}$$

- **High TTR ($> 0.65$)**: Academic, polymath, deific, or high-court orator.
- **Low TTR ($< 0.40$)**: Grunt soldier, uneducated laborer, or stoic guardian.

### 3.2 Yule's Characteristic $K$ (Length-Invariant Lexical Richness)
Because standard TTR decreases as sample size $N$ increases, authors can measure **Yule's Characteristic $K$**, which is mathematically independent of text length:

$$K = 10^4 \cdot \frac{\sum_{m=1}^{\infty} m^2 \cdot V(m, N) - N}{N^2}$$

Where $V(m, N)$ is the number of word types occurring exactly $m$ times in the corpus of $N$ tokens.

- **High $K$ ($> 140$)**: Highly repetitive, formulaic, or obsessively focused speaker.
- **Low $K$ ($< 60$)**: Rich, varied, expansive vocabulary with low repetition.

### 3.3 Utterance Length Cadence & Dispersion
Let character $c$ produce $M$ spoken dialogue utterances with word lengths $U = [u_1, u_2, \dots, u_M]$:

$$\mu_U = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{i=1}^M u_i, \qquad \sigma_U = \sqrt{\frac{1}{M} \sum_{i=1}^M (u_i - \mu_U)^2}$$

### 3.4 Heylighen & Dewaele Formality Metric ($F$)
Adapted for dialogue analysis to measure grammatical formality:

$$F = \min\left(100.0, \, \max\left(0.0, \, 50.0 + 2.5 \cdot (\bar{L}_{\text{word}} - 4.5) - 2.0 \cdot \text{ContractionRate} + 1.5 \cdot \text{SubordinationRate}\right)\right)$$

Where $\bar{L}_{\text{word}}$ is the mean word length in characters, and $\text{ContractionRate} = \frac{N_{\text{contractions}}}{N_{\text{words}}} \times 100$.

### 3.5 Pairwise Idiolect Cosine Similarity Matrix ($S$)
Every character's speech can be modeled as a normalized $6\text{D}$ feature vector:
$$\vec{V}_c = \left[ \text{TTR}_c, \, \mu_{U, c}, \, \sigma_{U, c}, \, F_c, \, \text{ContractionRate}_c, \, \text{RhetoricRatio}_c \right]$$

The voice similarity between Character $A$ and Character $B$:

$$S(A, B) = \cos(\theta) = \frac{\vec{V}_A \cdot \vec{V}_B}{\|\vec{V}_A\| \|\vec{V}_B\|} = \frac{\sum_{k=1}^6 V_{A, k} V_{B, k}}{\sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^6 V_{A, k}^2} \sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^6 V_{B, k}^2}}$$

- **Distinct Idiolects ($S < 0.80$)**: Strong voice separation; characters sound unmistakably different.
- **Moderate Similarity ($0.80 \le S < 0.92$)**: Acceptable overlap if characters share social class or military rank.
- **Voice Bleed Alarm ($S \ge 0.92$)**: Severe homogeny; characters share identical cadences, lengths, and vocabularies.

### 4.1 Authorial Self-Editing Checklist

1. **The Cover-the-Tags Test**: Read a dialogue sequence with all character names and speaker tags covered. Can you immediately identify who is speaking every line purely by word choice, rhythm, and attitude?
2. **Contraction Audit**: Ensure aristocrats, ancient beings, and formal non-native speakers do not slip into casual contractions (*don't, won't, it's*), and street characters do not speak in uncontracted Latinate periods.
3. **Dialogue Tag Discipline**: Audit all dialogue tags. Strip adverbs (*"she said angrily"* $\to$ physical beat) and eliminate melodramatic said-bookisms (*queried, opined, spat, ejaculated* $\to$ *"said"* or action beat).
4. **Metaphor Reservoir Check**: Check that characters use metaphors grounded in their trade and origin (a sailor speaks of tides and fathoms; an alchemist speaks of precipitates and reagents).

### 4.2 Diagnostic Self-Editing Matrix

| Rule Code | Severity | Description | Remediating Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| `VOI-101` | **CRITICAL** | Voice Bleed Detected ($S(A, B) \ge 0.92$) | Differentiate sentence lengths, contraction rates, and metaphor vocabularies between the two characters. |
| `VOI-102` | **HIGH** | Register Inconsistency (Aristocrat using street slang, or rogue speaking Latinate periods) | Realign dialogue with the character's defined sociolect in the Voice Bible. |
| `VOI-103` | **MEDIUM** | Monotonous Utterance Length ($\sigma_U \le 2.0$) | Vary character line lengths between terse 1-word replies and multi-clause statements. |
| `VOI-104` | **LOW** | Excessive Dialogue Tag Adverbs (*"she said angrily"*) | Eliminate adverb crutches; replace with physical action beats or subtextual dialogue. |
| `VOI-105` | **MEDIUM** | Said-Bookism Gluttony (*"he ejaculated, she opined, they bellowed"*) | Use invisible default tags (*"said"*, *"asked"*) or physical action beats. |
| `VOI-106` | **HIGH** | Low Lexical Distinctiveness (Character TTR indistinguishable from narrator) | Infuse character speech with specialized domain jargon, cultural idioms, or unique verbal tics. |

## 5. Practical Authorial Worksheets & Worked Masterclass Examples

### 5.1 Step-by-Step 3-Way Dialogue Transformation Case Study

#### Flawed Amateur Draft (Voice Bleed, Identical Formality, Said-Bookisms):
> "We must hurry because the imperial fleet is approaching the perimeter," said Valeria fearfully.  
> "I agree that we need to evacuate the civilians immediately," opined Marcus loudly.  
> "The security blast doors are already malfunctioning and will not hold," shouted Jax nervously.  
> "What is our plan to survive this terrible catastrophe?" queried Valeria passionately.

**Editorial Diagnostics:**
- Pairwise Cosine Similarity: $S(\text{Valeria}, \text{Marcus}) = 0.96$, $S(\text{Valeria}, \text{Jax}) = 0.95$ (**SEVERE VOICE BLEED — VOI-101**).
- Universal medium sentence length ($10 - 12\text{ words}$). Zero contraction variation. Terrible said-bookisms (*opined, queried*).

#### Masterclass Revision (Differentiated Idiolects, Sociolect Registers, Action Beats):
> Valeria gripped the tactical hololith, her eyes locked on the crimson transponder signatures. "Fleet vanguard drops out of warp in ninety seconds. Clear the civilian transports first." *(High-status commander: concise, imperative, low contraction rate)*  
> 
> Marcus spat on the grated decking. "Transports? Ain't no transports liftin' off with the primary mag-locks frozen shut, Commander. We're sittin' ducks." *(Underdeck engineer: heavy slang, contractions, mechanical metaphors)*  
> 
> Jax didn't look up from his data-slate. "Seventeen seconds until localized orbital bombardment. If we divert coolant from the auxiliary thrusters, we bypass the mag-locks with thirty-four percent thermal margin." *(Data-obsessed technician: precise metrics, zero emotion, Latinate technical jargon)*  
> 
> "Do it," Valeria said. "Now."

**Stylometric Improvements:**
- Pairwise Cosine Similarity: $S(\text{Valeria}, \text{Marcus}) = 0.64$, $S(\text{Marcus}, \text{Jax}) = 0.52$ (**EXEMPLARY IDIOLECT SEPARATION**).
- Tags stripped; character physical beats and distinct acoustic registers established.
