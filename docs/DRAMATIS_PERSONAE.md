## 1. Overview & Theoretical Rationale

The **Ars Arcanum Dramatis Personae Engine** (`scripts/lib/dramatis_personae.py`) is an offline character indexer, social network graph analyzer, ensemble role balancer, and publication appendix compiler for single novels and sprawling multi-volume series.

In multi-character speculative epics, tracking a cast across dozens of factions, viewpoints, and story arcs creates severe cognitive load for both author and reader:
1. **Name Collision Confusion (`CAS-101`)**: Introducing characters with phonetically or orthographically identical names (e.g. *Kaelen* and *Kaelas*, *Vance* and *Vane*), leading to reader disorientation.
2. **Ghost Characters (`CAS-102`)**: Minor characters appearing in prose without canonical dossiers in `World/Characters/*.md`.
3. **Post-Mortem Actions (`CAS-103`)**: Characters speaking or acting in scenes chronologically subsequent to their recorded death.
4. **Cast Bloat & Zero-Agency Observers (`CAS-104`)**: Characters who populate scenes without speaking, acting, or exerting dramatic agency.
5. **Ensemble Role Monoculture**: A squad where every character possesses identical personality archetypes (e.g. all sarcastic cynics), lacking dramatic friction and functional team specialization.

The engine parses character dossiers, extracts scene co-occurrences, evaluates phoneme/edit distance collision risks, models ensemble dynamics via Belbin and foil theory, and compiles camera-ready publication appendices.

## 2. Mathematical Modeling & Social Network Formulations

### 2.1 Character Social Graph & Co-Occurrence Matrix
The cast is modeled as a weighted undirected graph $G = (V, E, W)$, where vertices $v \in V$ represent characters and edges $(u, v) \in E$ represent shared scene co-occurrences with weight $W(u, v) = \text{number of shared scenes}$.

The symmetric co-occurrence matrix $\mathbf{C} \in \mathbb{N}^{|V| \times |V|}$ satisfies:

$$C_{ij} = \sum_{s \in \text{Scenes}} \mathbb{I}(c_i \in s \land c_j \in s)$$

### 2.2 Graph Centrality & Cast Prominence Metrics
To quantify narrative importance independently of raw line counts:

1. **Degree Centrality ($C_D$)** (Immediate conversational/social reach):
   $$C_D(v) = \frac{\sum_{u \ne v} W(v, u)}{|V| - 1}$$

2. **Betweenness Centrality ($C_B$)** (Measures how often character $v$ acts as the sole communication bridge between isolated factions):
   $$C_B(v) = \sum_{s \ne v \ne t} \frac{\sigma_{st}(v)}{\sigma_{st}}$$
   Where $\sigma_{st}$ is the number of shortest paths between $s$ and $t$, and $\sigma_{st}(v)$ is the number of those paths traversing $v$.

3. **Agency & POV Ratio ($A_r$)**:
   $$A_r(v) = \frac{\text{Scenes where } v \text{ is POV}}{\text{Total Scenes containing } v} \in [0.0, 1.0]$$

### 2.3 Levenshtein & Phonetic Name Collision Prevention
To prevent confusing character names, the engine computes string edit distance and phonetic hashing:

$$\text{Levenshtein Edit Distance}: \quad \text{dist}_{\text{Lev}}(s_1, s_2) \le 2 \implies \text{Flag CAS-101 (High Collision Risk)}$$

$$\text{Phonetic Collision}: \quad \text{DoubleMetaphone}(s_1) == \text{DoubleMetaphone}(s_2) \implies \text{Flag CAS-101 (Phonetic Homophone)}$$

Example: *Brandon* vs *Brendan* ($\text{dist} = 2$, identical Metaphone `PRNTN`) triggers an immediate naming warning.

## 3. Ensemble Cast Dynamics & Character Foil Architecture

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                        THE 9 BELBIN TEAM ROLES IN FICTION                         |
+-------------------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
| 1. Plant (Vision) | 4. Monitor Evaluator (Logic)  | 7. Implementer (Execution)    |
| 2. Resource Inv.  | 5. Shaper (Drive & Pressure)  | 8. Completer Finisher (Detail)|
| 3. Coordinator    | 6. Teamworker (Empathy/Glue)  | 9. Specialist (Technical Lore)|
+-------------------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
```

### 3.1 Dialectical Character Foils
A character foil highlights another character's traits through direct contrast or mirrored symmetry:
- **Diametric Foils**: Opposite traits (e.g. The reckless idealist vs the calculating cynic).
- **Complementary Foils**: Shared goals but contrasting methodologies (e.g. The lawful paladin vs the pragmatic assassin).
- **Protagonist-Antagonist Moral Symmetry (The Shadow Self)**:
  - Identical origin trauma (e.g. both lost their families in the same siege).
  - Contrasting moral axiom adopted in response:
    $$\text{Protagonist}: \quad \text{"No one else shall suffer this fate." (Self-sacrifice)}$$
    $$\text{Antagonist}: \quad \text{"The world is cruel; I will rule it." (Domination)}$$

## 4. Subfeatures Matrix & Diagnostic Codes

| Diagnostic Code | Flag | Trigger Condition | Corrective Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CAS-101` | `NAME_COLLISION` | Two character names share Levenshtein $\le 2$ or identical phonetic sound. | Rename one character to vary starting letters and syllable count. |
| `CAS-102` | `GHOST_CHARACTER` | Named character speaks in manuscript without dossier in `World/Characters/`. | Generate dossier or tag character as background extra. |
| `CAS-103` | `POST_MORTEM_SCENE` | Character appears in scene chronologically after their recorded death. | Remove character or tag scene as `@flashback` / `@hallucination`. |
| `CAS-104` | `LOW_AGENCY_EXTRA` | Major named character present in $> 10$ scenes with zero dialogue or decisions. | Give character a proactive objective or prune them from scene. |
| `CAS-105` | `ROLE_MONOCULTURE` | All members of an ensemble squad share the identical Belbin role (e.g. all Shapers). | Diversify cast roles (add a Teamworker or Specialist). |

## 6. Worked Step-by-Step Example

### Scenario: Auditing a 6-Person Heist Ensemble
1. **Cast List**:
   - *Kaelen* (Role: `coordinator` / Mastermind)
   - *Kaelas* (Role: `specialist` / Locksmith) $\to$ **CAS-101 Flag: Levenshtein distance = 1, Phonetic Collision**.
   - *Brann* (Role: `shaper` / Brawler)
   - *Dorian* (Role: `plant` / Illusionist)
   - *Lyra* (Role: `resource_investigator` / Fence)
   - *Theron* (Role: `completer_finisher` / Getaway Driver)
2. **Name Collision Resolution**: Rename *Kaelas* $\to$ *Zephyr Vance*. Distance from Kaelen becomes 9, phonetic collision cleared.
3. **Belbin Balance Check**: Roles present: Coordinator, Specialist, Shaper, Plant, Resource Investigator, Completer Finisher.
   - **Balance Result**: 6 distinct roles across 6 members. Zero role monoculture.
4. **Foil Dynamic**:
   - *Brann (Action/Brute Force)* vs *Zephyr (Patience/Precision)* $\implies$ Natural comic and tactical friction during infiltration scenes.
