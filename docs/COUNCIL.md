## 1. Overview & Theoretical Rationale

Human editing is prone to cognitive tunnel vision. An author focusing on line-level prose cadence will frequently overlook a catastrophic plot hole or magic-system thermodynamic violation in the same chapter; conversely, an author engrossed in macro act pacing will miss that every character in an ensemble scene has identical sentence lengths and said-bookism dialogue tags.

The **Multi-Perspective Editorial Council** is an offline dialectical self-editing framework designed to eliminate authorial blind spots by evaluating manuscripts through **four specialized, dialectically opposing critical lenses**:

1. **The Architect (Plot Doctor & Structuralist)**: Analyzes Swain MRU causality, dramatic polarity shifts ($\Delta \Pi$), beat-sheet alignment, and tension splines.
2. **The Skeptic (Lore Auditor & Worldbuilding Doctor)**: Enforces magic system thermodynamic conservation, timeline synchronization, deific portfolio conflicts, and geographic plausibility.
3. **The Stylist (Sensory & Prose Artist)**: Audits Gary Provost sentence rhythm ($\sigma$), 8-channel Shannon sensory entropy ($H_{\text{sensory}}$), defamiliarization, and filter-word density.
4. **The Producer (Commercial & Audience Advocate / Voice Coach)**: Evaluates character idiolect distinctiveness (Cosine Similarity $S(A, B)$), reader cognitive load, chapter cliffhangers, and emotional stakes.

## 2. Theoretical Foundations of Editorial Dialectics & Critical Narratology

### 2.1 The Four-Pass Editorial Pipeline
Professional book publishing separates editing into four distinct, non-overlapping passes. Attempting to execute all four simultaneously guarantees cognitive exhaustion and editorial failure:

```
 ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
 │                   THE FOUR-PASS EDITORIAL PIPELINE                      │
 ├───────────────────┬─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
 │ Pass 1: Develop-  │ Macro structure, premise promises, character arcs,  │
 │ mental & Arc      │ act turning points, pacing velocity, thematic unity │
 ├───────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
 │ Pass 2: Lore &    │ World Bible continuity, magic system costs/limits,  │
 │ Continuity        │ timeline sync, faction motivations, geography travel│
 ├───────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
 │ Pass 3: Line &    │ Sentence cadence (Provost σ), 8-channel senses,     │
 │ Stylistics        │ idiolect separation, filter verbs, rhetorical figures│
 ├───────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
 │ Pass 4: Copy &    │ Acoustic prosody, sibilance/plosive clashes, typos, │
 │ Proofreading      │ punctuation mechanics, layout formatting            │
 └───────────────────┴─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 2.2 The Dialectical Tension of Editorial Feedback
The four council personas are intentionally designed to exist in productive creative tension:

- **The Architect vs. The Stylist**: The Architect demands high narrative velocity ($V = \frac{\Delta \mathcal{E}}{\Delta W}$) and rapid disaster escalation; The Stylist demands scene dilation, contemplative sensory grounding, and poetic defamiliarization.
- **The Skeptic vs. The Producer**: The Skeptic demands rigorous thermodynamic consistency and realistic travel timelines; The Producer demands fast emotional payoffs and immediate character conflict, warning against academic worldbuilding over-explanation.

Authors synthesize these opposing demands through an objective **Trade-Off Reconciliation Matrix**.

## 3. Mathematical Formulations & Composite Health Scoring

```mermaid

    title "Editorial Council Dimension Scores for Chapter 14 (Radar Projection)"
    x-axis ["Plot Doctor (30%)", "Lore Auditor (25%)", "Voice Coach (25%)", "Sensory Stylist (20%)"]
    y-axis "Domain Score (0 - 100)" 0 --> 100
    line [85, 92, 64, 78]
```

### 3.1 Composite Chapter Health Score ($\mathcal{S}_{\text{chapter}}$)
The overall score for a chapter is a weighted linear combination of the four domain evaluations:

$$\mathcal{S}_{\text{chapter}}(c) = \omega_{\text{plot}} S_{\text{plot}}(c) + \omega_{\text{lore}} S_{\text{lore}}(c) + \omega_{\text{voice}} S_{\text{voice}}(c) + \omega_{\text{sensory}} S_{\text{sensory}}(c)$$

Where the standard baseline weights are:
$$\omega_{\text{plot}} = 0.30, \quad \omega_{\text{lore}} = 0.25, \quad \omega_{\text{voice}} = 0.25, \quad \omega_{\text{sensory}} = 0.20$$

$$\sum_{k=1}^4 \omega_k = 1.0$$

### 3.2 Minimum Competency Threshold & Catastrophic Penalty
A manuscript cannot compensate for a fatal structural defect (such as an unresolved dead-end or severe character voice bleed) simply by having beautiful sensory prose. Apply a **Catastrophic Domain Penalty**:

$$S_{\text{final}}(c) = \begin{cases} 
\mathcal{S}_{\text{chapter}}(c) & \text{if } \min_k S_k(c) \ge 60.0 \\
\mathcal{S}_{\text{chapter}}(c) \times \left(\frac{\min_k S_k(c)}{60.0}\right)^2 & \text{if } \min_k S_k(c) < 60.0
\end{cases}$$

### 3.3 Publication Grade Classification Table

| Composite Score | Grade Rating | Publication Readiness | Action Required |
|---|---|---|---|
| $92.0 - 100.0$ | **Grade A+** | **Masterclass / Release Ready** | Proceed to final proofreading and typography build. |
| $83.0 - 91.9$ | **Grade A** | **Commercial Standard** | Polish minor flagged line echoes or sibilance clusters. |
| $74.0 - 82.9$ | **Grade B** | **Substantive Polish Required** | Rebalance sensory channels or sharpen character idiolects. |
| $60.0 - 73.9$ | **Grade C** | **Developmental Remediation** | Rewrite scene mechanics; fix inverted MRUs or pacing flatlines. |
| $< 60.0$ | **Grade F** | **Critical Structural Failure** | Structural overhaul: missing turning points, plot holes, or voice bleed. |

## 6. Practical Authorial Worksheets & Worked Masterclass Examples

### 6.1 Multi-Agent Editorial Diagnosis & Reconciliation Case Study

#### The Raw Scene Draft (Chapter 14):
> Valeria walked into the command bunker. She saw Inquisitor Vane standing near the terminal. She felt terrified because she knew he had discovered her secret cipher.  
> "I know what you did," said Inquisitor Vane angrily.  
> "You cannot prove anything," whispered Valeria nervously.  
> Inquisitor Vane used his telekinetic magic to shatter the terminal into pieces without any effort at all. Valeria ran out the door.

#### The Council Persona Critiques:
1. **Plot Doctor**: *"Score: 45/100. Catastrophic lack of conflict and missing disaster. Valeria simply flees without any consequence. Polarity shift is flat."*
2. **Lore Auditor**: *"Score: 35/100. Severe Magic System Violation: Inquisitor Vane shatters a reinforced terminal with telekinesis without suffering neural burn or consuming solarite catalyst (violates World/Magic-Technology/Thaumaturgy.md Rule 3)."*
3. **Voice Coach**: *"Score: 50/100. Severe Voice Bleed. Dialogue tags use weak adverbs ('angrily', 'nervously'). Character idiolects are identical."*
4. **Sensory Stylist**: *"Score: 30/100. White Room Syndrome. 100% visual. Filter verbs ('saw', 'felt', 'knew') dominate every line."*

#### Composite Score:
$$\mathcal{S}_{\text{raw}} = 0.30(45) + 0.25(35) + 0.25(50) + 0.20(30) = 40.75 \implies \mathbf{GRADE\ F\ (FAIL)}$$

---

#### The Masterclass Revision (Reconciled Across All 4 Personas):
> The smell of scorched insulation and stale sweat hit Valeria the moment the bunker hatch hissed open. *(Sensory Stylist: Olfactory + Auditory)*  
> Inquisitor Vane stood over the holographic terminal, bathed in the sickly green light of the decrypted telemetry. He did not turn. *(Architect: Stimulus beat)*  
> Valeria’s pulse spiked against her collarbone; cold adrenaline paralyzed her tongue. *(Architect: Visceral reflex before thought)*  
> *He has the raw cipher,* her mind raced. *Three seconds before the lockdown triggers.* *(Plot Doctor: Cognitive thought)*  
> 
> "The blood-seal on the imperial archive was keyed to your grandfather's DNA, Valeria," Vane said, his voice measured, devoid of heat. "There are no coincidences in the judiciary." *(Voice Coach: Distinct high-status idiolect, no tag)*  
> 
> "Then you also know why he hid it," she said, her fingers locking around the hilt of her plasma cutter. *(Voice Coach: Action beat)*  
> 
> Vane raised his left gauntlet. A halo of heat-shimmer warped the air as veins blackened along his forearm—the agonizing tax of unchanneled kinetic thaumaturgy. *(Lore Auditor: Thermodynamic cost enforced)* The terminal buckled with an ear-splitting shriek of sheared titanium, spraying superheated sparks across the deck. *(Sensory Stylist: Auditory, tactile, visual)*  
> 
> The blast severed the master power conduit. The blast doors slammed shut, plunging them into crimson emergency darkness with the air scrubbers grinding to a dead halt. *(Architect: Disaster - "Yes, but now trapped with the antagonist")*

#### Revised Council Evaluation:
$$\mathcal{S}_{\text{revised}} = 0.30(96) + 0.25(98) + 0.25(94) + 0.20(95) = \mathbf{95.8\ (GRADE\ A+\ /\ RELEASE\ READY)}$$
