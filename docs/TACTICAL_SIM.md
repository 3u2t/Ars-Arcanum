## 1. Executive Summary & Epistemological Architecture

The **Ars Arcanum Tactical Warfare & Wargaming Engine** (`scripts/lib/tactical_sim.py`) is an offline battle simulation compiler, Lanchester combat attrition integrator, troop morale collapse auditor, and army march column calculator designed for military fantasy novelists, wargame system designers, and historical tacticians.

Military combat in fiction frequently succumbs to Hollywood romanticisms that contradict operational reality:
1. **The "Fight to the Last Man" Fallacy (`TAC-101`)**: Depicting armies fighting down to 99% extermination before breaking, ignoring that historical armies almost universally rout and dissolve upon sustaining **10%–30% casualties**.
2. **Linear Mass Scaling Errors (`TAC-102`)**: Treating a 2:1 numerical advantage as merely twice as effective in ranged or concentrated combat, ignoring Lanchester's Square Law where a 2:1 numerical superiority yields a **4:1 combat advantage**.
3. **The Bloodbath Myth of the Clashing Line**: Assuming the majority of casualties occur during the shield wall clash, ignoring that **80%–90% of all battlefield casualties occur during the rout** when broken troops drop shields and flee.
4. **Column Length Amnesia**: Depicting an army of 40,000 marching onto a battlefield simultaneously, ignoring that their single-file road column stretches over $35\text{ km}$, taking 10+ hours to deploy into battle lines.

The Tactical Engine numerically integrates Lanchester differential equations, tracks cumulative morale shock multipliers, computes terrain/fortification defilade modifiers, and simulates unit routing dynamics.

## 2. The Lanchester Combat Power Laws

Frederick W. Lanchester (1916) formulated the mathematical foundations of military attrition. The outcome of a battle depends entirely on whether forces engage in **unaimed/ancient duels** (Linear Law) or **concentrated targeted fire** (Square Law).

```
                      [ LANCHESTER ENGAGEMENT REGIMES ]
  1. LINEAR LAW (Ancient Melee)        ──► dB/dt = -β  ;  dR/dt = -α  ──► Power ∝ N · Quality
  2. SQUARE LAW (Ranged Concentration) ──► dB/dt = -β R;  dR/dt = -α B──► Power ∝ N² · Quality
```

### 2.1 Lanchester’s Linear Law (Ancient Melee & Frontage-Constrained Duels)
When units fight along a narrow front (e.g., Thermopylae pass, shield wall clash) where only the soldiers in the front rank can engage, each warrior fights one opponent at a time:

$$\frac{dB}{dt} = -\beta, \quad \frac{dR}{dt} = -\alpha$$

Integrating across battle duration:

$$\beta (R_0 - R(t)) = \alpha (B_0 - B(t))$$

- **Combat Power Metric**:
  $$\text{Combat Power}_{\text{Linear}} = \text{Force Size } N \times \text{Individual Quality } \alpha$$
  In narrow melee choke points, high individual quality (Spartan hoplites, elite knights) can hold off vast numerical superiorities.

### 2.2 Lanchester’s Square Law (Modern Ranged & Targeted Concentrated Fire)
When every unit in Force Red can freely acquire, target, and fire upon any unit in Force Blue simultaneously (e.g., longbow volleys, musket lines, artillery salvos, starship broadsides):

$$\frac{dB}{dt} = -\beta R(t)$$
$$\frac{dR}{dt} = -\alpha B(t)$$

Where $\alpha$ is Red's individual kill-rate efficiency and $\beta$ is Blue's efficiency. Multiplying and integrating:

$$\beta \left( R_0^2 - R(t)^2 \right) = \alpha \left( B_0^2 - B(t)^2 \right)$$

- **Lanchester's Law of Fighting Power**:
  $$\text{Fighting Power} = \alpha \cdot N^2$$

#### The Geometric Power of Numerical Superiority:
Because fighting power scales with the **square of troop numbers ($N^2$)**, numerical superiority dominates individual unit quality:
- If Force Red has $2,000$ archers ($\alpha = 1.0$) and Force Blue has $1,000$ elite archers ($\beta = 1.5$):
  $$\text{Power}(\text{Red}) = 1.0 \times 2,000^2 = 4,000,000$$
  $$\text{Power}(\text{Blue}) = 1.5 \times 1,000^2 = 1,500,000$$
  Force Red possesses **$2.67\times$ the combat power** of Force Blue and will annihilate Blue with minimal losses.
- *Clausewitz's Principle of the Schwerpunkt*: Concentrating forces locally transforms a fair fight into an overwhelmingly asymmetric Lanchester Square slaughter.

## 3. Force Multipliers & Tactical Terrain Modifiers

Composite operational effectiveness $\alpha_{\text{eff}}$ scales the base unit lethality:

$$\alpha_{\text{eff}} = \alpha_0 \times \prod_{k} M_k$$

```
                        [ TACTICAL MULTIPLIER MATRIX ]
  Factor                      Modifier (M_k)    Tactical Effect
  ──────                      ──────────────    ───────────────
  High Ground / Crest Defense +25% to +50%      Gravity boosts missile range / slows charge
  Stone Castle Defilade       4.0x to 10.0x     Massive missile protection; narrow arrow slits
  Encirclement / Flank Attack 2.0x to 3.0x      Nullifies shields; triggers catastrophic panic
  Deep Mud / Trench Obstacle  0.3x to 0.5x      Neutralizes cavalry shock charge velocity
  Heavy Rain / High Winds     0.2x to 0.5x      Slacks bowstrings; ruins gunpowder priming
```

## 4. Morale Mechanics & The Anatomy of the Rout

Historical battle studies by John Keegan (*The Face of Battle*) and Col. Trevor N. Dupuy prove that armies are psychological entities, not mathematical health bars.

```

### 4.1 Historical Casualty Breaking Points
- **Conscript / Green Levy**: Routs after sustaining **$5\%\text{–}10\%$ casualties**.
- **Standard Regular Infantry**: Routs after sustaining **$15\%\text{–}20\%$ casualties**.
- **Hardened Veterans / Knights**: Routs after sustaining **$30\%\text{–}40\%$ casualties**.
- **Fanatical Martyrs / Paladins**: Breaks only at $> 50\%$ (historically exceedingly rare; e.g., Spartans at Thermopylae, Swiss Guard at Rome).

### 4.2 Shock Events Triggering Instant Morale Collapse
Even at $0\%$ physical casualties, a unit immediately breaks if subjected to sudden psychological shock:
1. **General / Sovereign Slain**: Sudden loss of supreme command ($\text{Morale Penalty } -50\%$).
2. **Cavalry Charge from the Rear**: Sudden realization of entrapment ($\text{Morale Penalty } -60\%$).
3. **Adjacent Friendly Unit Routing**: Contagious panic spreading across the line.
4. **Ammunition Exhaustion**: Missile troops unable to return fire.

### 4.3 The Slaughter of the Rout
> **In pre-modern warfare, 80% to 90% of all battle casualties occur *after* the line breaks.**

While the shield wall holds, armor and shields keep casualty rates low ($< 5\%\text{/hour}$). Once the line turns its back and flees, fleeing soldiers throw down heavy shields and weapons, enabling pursuing light cavalry and skirmishers to butcher them from behind with zero retaliation.

## 5. Column Length & Operational March Logistics

An army on the march does not travel in wide battle lines; it moves in narrow single- or double-file columns along dirt roads.

```
  ◄── 10 km Vanguard ──►◄───── 15 km Main Body ─────►◄── 12 km Baggage Train ──►
  ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  Total Road Column Length L_column ≈ 37 km (Takes 10+ hours to pass a single point)
```

### 5.1 The March Column Length Formula
For an army of $N_{\text{inf}}$ infantry, $N_{\text{cav}}$ cavalry, and $N_{\text{wagons}}$ supply wagons:

$$L_{\text{column}} = \left( \frac{N_{\text{inf}}}{D_{\text{inf}}} \right) + \left( \frac{N_{\text{cav}}}{D_{\text{cav}}} \right) + \left( N_{\text{wagons}} \times \Delta_{\text{wagon}} \right)$$

Where typical road marching densities are:
- Infantry marching 4-abreast: $D_{\text{inf}} \approx 2,000\text{ men/km}$ (with spacing).
- Cavalry marching 2-abreast: $D_{\text{cav}} \approx 400\text{ horses/km}$.
- Baggage wagons: $\Delta_{\text{wagon}} \approx 20\text{ meters per wagon}$ ($50\text{ wagons/km}$).

#### Example: A Medieval Royal Host of 20,000 Men
- $15,000$ Infantry (4-abreast): $\frac{15,000}{2,000} = 7.5\text{ km}$.
- $5,000$ Cavalry (2-abreast): $\frac{5,000}{400} = 12.5\text{ km}$.
- $600$ Supply Wagons: $600 \times 0.02\text{ km} = 12.0\text{ km}$.
- **Total Column Length**: $L_{\text{column}} = 7.5 + 12.5 + 12.0 = 32.0\text{ km}$.

*Operational Reality*: If the vanguard arrives at a battlefield at 08:00, the rearguard and supply wagons will not arrive until after 18:00. An enemy ambushing the column in transit will defeat the army piecemeal.

## 6. Worked Step-by-Step Tactical Simulation

### Scenario: The Battle of the Red Ridge
- **Force Red (Defenders on High Ground)**: $3,000$ longbowmen on a steep ridge ($M_{\text{terrain}} = 1.4$), kill-rate efficiency $\alpha = 0.08\text{ kills/min/man}$.
- **Force Blue (Attackers in the Plain)**: $5,000$ armored crossbowmen, kill-rate efficiency $\beta = 0.05\text{ kills/min/man}$.
- Both forces engage simultaneously in targeted ranged combat (Lanchester Square Law).
- Morale breaking threshold: $20\%$ losses for Blue ($1,000$ casualties); $25\%$ losses for Red ($750$ casualties).

#### Step 1: Compute Effective Effectiveness Coefficients
- $\alpha_{\text{eff}} = \alpha \times M_{\text{terrain}} = 0.08 \times 1.40 = 0.112$.
- $\beta_{\text{eff}} = 0.050$.

#### Step 2: Calculate Lanchester Combat Power
$$\text{Power}(\text{Red}) = \alpha_{\text{eff}} \times R_0^2 = 0.112 \times (3000)^2 = 0.112 \times 9,000,000 = 1,008,000$$
$$\text{Power}(\text{Blue}) = \beta_{\text{eff}} \times B_0^2 = 0.050 \times (5000)^2 = 0.050 \times 25,000,000 = 1,250,000$$

*Initial Outlook*: Blue holds a slight total power edge ($1.25\text{M}$ vs $1.01\text{M}$), but will Blue break from morale before Red is defeated?

#### Step 3: Determine Losses at Blue's Morale Break Threshold
Blue routs when $B(t) = 4,000$ ($1,000$ casualties sustained).
Using the Lanchester invariant:

$$\alpha_{\text{eff}} (B_0^2 - B(t)^2) = \beta_{\text{eff}} (R_0^2 - R(t)^2)$$

$$0.112 \times \left( 5000^2 - 4000^2 \right) = 0.050 \times \left( 3000^2 - R(t)^2 \right)$$

$$0.112 \times (25,000,000 - 16,000,000) = 0.050 \times (9,000,000 - R^2)$$

$$0.112 \times 9,000,000 = 1,008,000$$

$$9,000,000 - R(t)^2 = \frac{1,008,000}{0.050} = 20,160,000$$

*Mathematical Implication*: Because $20,160,000 > 9,000,000$, Red's roster $R(t)^2$ reaches zero *before* Blue loses $1,000$ men. 
Let's find Red's casualties when Red hits its own $25\%$ breaking point ($R(t) = 2,250$):

$$0.050 \times (3000^2 - 2250^2) = 0.050 \times (9,000,000 - 5,062,500) = 0.050 \times 3,937,500 = 196,875$$

$$B_0^2 - B(t)^2 = \frac{196,875}{0.112} = 1,757,812$$

$$B(t)^2 = 25,000,000 - 1,757,812 = 23,242,188 \implies B(t) \approx 4,821 \text{ men}$$

*Battle Conclusion*: Force Red sustains $750$ casualties and **routs from the ridge**. Force Blue loses only $179$ men ($3.6\%$ casualties). Blue's overwhelming $5:3$ numerical mass completely overcame Red's high-ground advantage.
