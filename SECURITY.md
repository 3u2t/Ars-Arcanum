# Security Policy: Ars Arcanum

## 1. Scope & Posture

Ars Arcanum is a single-user offline authoring and worldbuilding platform. It is designed to run locally on Linux workstations without persistent network listening daemons, setuid binaries, or remote service endpoints.

Security priorities for Ars Arcanum focus on:
- **Local Execution Safety**: Safe handling of arbitrary filenames, shell escaping, path traversal prevention, and sandboxed temporary directories.
- **Data Protection & Integrity**: Non-destructive operations, transactional directory creation, crash recovery, and verified backup archives.
- **Supply Chain Integrity**: SHA-256 digest validation of downloaded binaries (e.g., Typst) and immutable pinning of external CI actions and dependencies.

### Installer Privilege Surface (disclosed)

`setup_arcanum.sh` is the only component that elevates privileges. For transparency, everything it does with `sudo` is enumerated here:

- `sudo apt-get update` and `sudo apt-get install` for the ~30 explicitly named packages and 7 font packages declared inside the script (no wildcards, no third-party PPAs).
- `sudo flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists --system flathub` and `sudo flatpak install --system` (with `--user` fallback) for exactly the three Flathub app IDs listed in `docs/COMPATIBILITY.md`.
- `sudo install -m 755` of the Typst release binary into `/usr/local/bin/typst` — performed **only** after the GitHub-published SHA-256 digest matches; installation is refused when the digest is unavailable.
- `gio set metadata::trusted true` on the specific desktop launcher files the installer itself created (no bulk filesystem metadata changes).

`uninstall_arcanum.sh` reverts the desktop launchers, and with `--purge-flatpaks` also removes the Flatpak apps and `/usr/local/bin/typst`. No Ars Arcanum script writes outside `${HOME}` (world data), `/usr/local/bin/typst`, and the package/Flatpak targets declared above. Restores additionally refuse archives containing path-traversal members, symlinks (`l`), dangerous `.git/config` configurations, or executable git hooks. Flatpak packaging operates without host D-Bus grants. Passphrases are passed via standard input (`--passphrase-fd 0`) rather than process argument lists.
